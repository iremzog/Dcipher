[{"Title":"Electrospinning of Grooved Polystyrene Fibers: Effect of Solvent Systems","Abstract":"Secondary surface texture is of great significance to morphological variety and further expands the application areas of electrospun nanofibers. This paper presents the possibility of directly electrospinning grooved polystyrene (PS) fibers using both single and binary solvent systems. Solvents were classified as low boiling point solvent (LBPS): dichloromethane (DCM), acetone (ACE), and tetrahydrofuran (THF); high boiling point solvent (HBPS): N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and cyclohexanone (CYCo); and non-solvent (NS): 1-butanol (BuOH). By the systematic selection and combination of these solvents at given parameters, we found that single solvent systems produced non-grooved fibers. LBPS\/DMF solvent systems resulted in fibers with different grooved textures, while LBPS\/CYCo led to fibers with double grooved texture. Grooved fibers can also be fabricated from LBPS\/LBPS, NS\/LBPS, and NS\/HBPS systems under specific conditions. The results indicated that the difference of evaporation rate (DER) between the two solvents played a key role in the formation of grooved texture. The formation of this unique texture should be attributed to three separate mechanisms, namely void-based elongation, wrinkle-based elongation, and collapsed jet-based elongation. Our findings can serve as guidelines for the preparation of ultrafine fibers with grooved secondary texture.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Sediment microbial fuel cells as a new source of renewable and sustainable energy: present status and future prospects","Abstract":"Active biocatalysts such as microorganisms or enzymes liberate electrons while electron donors are consumed in biological fuel cells. Biological fuel cells are a novel technology producing bio-electrochemical power using various materials such as complex organic waste or natural organic matter under anaerobic anode conditions. Recently, great attention has been paid to biological fuel cells due to their mild operating conditions and use of a variety of biodegradable substrates as fuel. Sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) are a kind of microbial fuel cell (MFC) that can produce electrical current from the organic matter content of sediment using bacterial metabolism. SMFCs have been developed in the past decade to provide a renewable power source and organic matter removal. SMFCs differ from other MFCs due to their essentially complete anoxic conditions at the anode and their membrane-less structure. To further improve SMFC technology, this paper focuses on the limitations and challenges of SMFCs and collects the latest surveys in this field.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Hierarchical multi-component nanofiber separators for lithium polysulfide capture in lithium-sulfur batteries: an experimental and molecular modeling study","Abstract":"Sulfur (S) has been considered as a promising cathode candidate for lithium batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity and energy density. However, the low active material utilization, severe capacity fading, and short lifespan of the resultant lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have greatly hindered their practicality. In this work, a multi-functional polyacrylonitrile\/silica nanofiber membrane with an integral ultralight and thin multi-walled carbon nanotube sheet is presented and it provides a new approach to significantly improve the overall electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. The experimental results are in agreement with molecular modeling studies based on density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, this design is favorable for the fast diffusion of both lithium ions and electrons and the mitigation of the diffusion of polysulfides. As a consequence, a high reversible capacity of 741 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C after 100 cycles with excellent cyclability and high-rate performance (627 mA h g(-1) at 1C) are achieved even with a high sulfur loading of 70 wt% in the cathode, revealing its great potential for energy storage applications. Moreover, a capacity of 426 mA h g(-1) is retained after 300 cycles at a high current density of 2C. These results represent a major step forward in the progress of Li-S battery technologies.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"A facile approach for the fabrication of nano-attapulgite\/poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)\/biopolymers core-sheath ultrafine fibrous mats for drug controlled release","Abstract":"Herein, we report a facile method for the fabrication of flurbiprofen axetil (FA)-loaded core-sheath composite ultrafine fibers for drug sustained release. In our work, porous attapulgite nanorods (n-AT) were selected as carriers to load the model drug-flurbiprofen axetil (FA). The FA-loaded n-AT (FA@n-AT) with an optimized FA loading efficiency of 89.5% was initially dispersed in a poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) solution as a core layer composite. Then, FA@n-AT\/PVP was incorporated within biopolymer ultrafine fibers through coaxial electrospinning to form FA@n-AT\/PVP\/biopolymers core-sheath ultrafine fibers, which exhibited a uniform and smooth morphology. The loaded FA within the PVP\/biopolymers coaxial ultrafine fibers showed a sustained release profile. Due to their significantly reduced burst-release profile, the developed FA@n-AT\/PVP\/biopolymers core-sheath ultrafine fibers are proposed to be a promising material in the field of pharmaceutical science.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Facile preparation of nitrogen-doped porous carbon from waste tobacco by a simple pre-treatment process and their application in electrochemical capacitor and CO2 capture","Abstract":"Preparing nitrogen-doped porous carbons directly from waste biomass has received considerable interest for the purpose of realizing the atomic economy.

Some physical properties such as particle size, apparent density, conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, and elemental analysis of the materials were determined. Electrokinetic properties of the materials were investigated by means of zeta ()-potential measurements in aqueous and non-aqueous (silicone oil) media. The effects of time, pH, various electrolytes, surfactants, and temperature onto -potentials of the dispersions prepared in aqueous media were examined. It was concluded that the positive -potential of polypyrrole shifted to more positive regions, and the isoelectric point of the polypyrrole concomitantly shifted to higher pH values after interaction with polycationic chitosan matrix. Polypyrrole-graft-chitosan\/silicone oil suspensions were observed to be electrorheological active when subjected to external electric field strength. Creep and creep-recovery tests were applied to the suspensions and a relationship was established between viscoelastic response and -potential of the materials. Furthermore, polypyrrole-graft-chitosan-based smart electrorheological fluid was observed to behave as a viscoelastic material and exhibited a reversible nonlinear viscoelastic deformation under externally applied electric field strength.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Effect of coarse particle volume fraction on the hydraulic conductivity of fresh cement based material","Abstract":"Hydraulic conductivity or permeability is a key parameter that affects the stability of fresh cement-based materials. For example, bleeding and water retention are among the most important issues governed by concrete permeability. Whereas this parameter is relatively easy to measure at the cement paste scale, it is difficult to evaluate with the addition of sand or gravel due to the sample size needed to obtain a representative sample. For ordinary permeability measurement, the test duration is linearly linked to the sample height. The aim of this study is to relate the concrete permeability to the cement paste permeability for various aggregate volume fractions in mortar or concrete. The proposed model uses an adaptation of Darcy's law to compute concrete permeability from measured cement paste permeability and mix-design parameters. This model has been successfully tested with kaolin and cement pastes with spherical aggregates (glass beads) and sand.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Nitrogen-containing mesoporous carbons with high capacitive properties derived from a gelatin biomolecule","Abstract":"Nitrogen-rich mesoporous carbons were synthesized using an inexpensive and readily available gelatin biopolymer as a carbon\/nitrogen precursor and colloidal silica as a hard template. The resulting materials exhibited large pore volumes of up to 4.38 cm(3)\/g, bimodal porosity (pores centered at approximately 3 and 24-28 nm) and contained high levels of bulk and surface nitrogen (up to 10 wt% and 5.8 at.%, respectively). The electrochemical properties of the carbons were evaluated in 6 M KOH and 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solutions via cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge\/discharge cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The samples exhibited high capacitances of up to 230 and 335 F\/g in alkaline and acidic solutions, respectively. The capacitance retention in the acidic solution at a high potential sweep rate (100 mV\/s) was lower (75-80%) than that in the alkaline medium (similar to 94%), suggesting that pseudocapacitance contributes less effectively in quick charge\/discharge operations. The influence of the chemistry of gelatin on its compatibility with colloidal silica is discussed. It is shown that if the values of the isoelectric point of the gelatin and the pH of the colloidal silica solution are similar, then excessive self-association and precipitation may occur, thereby decreasing the porosity of the resulting carbons.

The viscosity of the deacetylated chitin nanofiber\/SBE-beta-CyD gel was higher by about one order of magnitude at a 1.0 w\/v % concentration of SBE-beta-CyD. Both the elastic (G') and viscous (G '') moduli of the deacetylated chitin-nanofiber gel increased in the presence of SBE-beta-CyD, and the G' values were much higher than the G '' values.

The surface-fluorinated BST NF (F-BST NF) exhibit excellent dispersion in the PVDF polymer matrix and strong interfacial adhesion with the matrix, leading to excellent flexibility for the composites. The composites exhibit the optimum dielectric performance (i.e. high dielectric constant and high breakdown strength). With 2.5 vol% of F-BST NF, the extractable energy density of the F-BST NF\/PVDF composites is 7.5 J cm(-3), which is three times as high as that of a pure PVDF matrix, showing good potential for energy storage applications.

These catalysts were also evaluated with regard to the hydrothermal conversion of cellulose to lactic acid. Lactic acid yields as high as 67.6% were obtained when reacting 0.3 g cellulose, 0.1 g catalyst and 30 mL water at 240 degrees C under 2 MPa N-2 for 30 min. Upon recycling of the catalyst, the lactic acid yields decreased from 67.6 to 58.7 to 55.9% during the first, second and third trials. Beginning with the second trial the catalyst behaved as a true heterogeneous catalyst for the conversion of cellulose to lactic acid. The observed decreases in catalytic activity during recycling could be due to a combination of erbium ion leaching, deposition of carbon species in pores and partial structural changes in the catalyst.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Controlling electrodeposited conducting polymer nanostructures with the number and the length of fluorinated chains for adjusting superhydrophobic properties and adhesion","Abstract":"Controlling the formation of surface nanostructures is highly important for various applications, and in particular for superhydrophobic properties. Here, taking 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) as a model molecule, we study the influence of the decrease in the perfluorocarbon chain length or the use of two shorter perfluorocarbon chains on the formation of surface nanostructures and superhydrophobicity by electropolymerization. Moreover, perfluorinated compounds, especially those with long perfluorocarbon chains, are used a lot in industry but their persistence, bioaccumulation potential and toxicity alternatives are yet to be discovered. It seems that their effect is dependent on the perfluorinated chain length and that alternatives with shorter perfluorinated chains can be envisaged. Here, we show in the fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces that the use of shorter perfluorocarbon chains can even, in certain conditions, lead to better properties. Superhydrophobic properties with extremely low hysteresis are obtained with long perfluorocarbon chains (C8F17) but very close properties are also obtained with short perfluorobutyl (C4F9) and even perfluoroethyl (C2F5) chains. Superoleophilic properties are obtained with C2F5 chains, whereas the best oleophobic properties were found with C4F9 chains. This is due to a change in the surface morphology from cauliflower structures to nanofibers as the perfluorocarbon chain decreases. By contrast, the use of two shorter perfluorocarbon chains induces very high steric hindrance during the electropolymerization and as a consequence smoother surfaces with lower surface hydrophobicity. Hence, it is possible to form structured or smooth surfaces using one or two fluorinated chains, respectively.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Synthesis of titanium cross-linked chitosan composite for efficient adsorption and detoxification of hexavalent chromium from water","Abstract":"For the simultaneous adsorption and detoxification of hexavalent chromium from water, a new titanium-chitosan (Ti-CTS) composite was synthesized through a metal-binding reaction between titanium ions and the chitosan biopolymer followed by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde.

The adsorption properties toward Cr(VI) were systematically investigated as a function of pH, dosage, initial concentration, contact time, temperature and co-existing ions. Experimental data were well described by the Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo-second order model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 171 mg g(-1). More attractively, the Cr(VI) could be effectively adsorbed and reduced to the less toxic Cr(III) by the Ti-CTS composite.

Freeze drying offers an efficient way for preserving wooden artifacts. In order to rationally design the freeze drying process, thermophysical studies were carried out in this paper. The measurements of water vapor diffusion coefficient and thermal conductivity were made. The impacts of cooling velocity and grain orientation on effective diffusion coefficient of water vapor, D, in dried wood were investigated. At low cooling velocity, 0.2 K\/min, D was (4.8 +\/- 0.4) x 10(-4) m(2)\/s in parallel grain direction, or (1.9 +\/- 0.4) x 10(-4) m(2)\/s in perpendicular grain direction; at higher cooling velocity, 3.0 K\/min, D was (4.3 +\/- 0.2) x 10(-4) m(2)\/s in parallel grain direction, or (1.2 +\/- 0.1) x 10(-4) m(2)\/s in perpendicular grain direction. The thermal conductivity of the dried sample was in the range of 0.78-1.06 W\/(m K). With the values attained, one-dimensional pseudo-steady analysis were made for the primary drying process of a cylinder and a flat slab. It was found that the process was mass-transfer controlled and the difference between surface temperature and sublimation temperature was very limited. Thus only mass transfer equation needed to be solved with assumption of constant sublimation temperature. The primary drying of a two-dimensional object was also simulated to predict the time required. Monitoring the surface temperature of each artifact and handling artifacts with similar drying time in a batch are proposed for the freeze drying of archaeological artifacts. The freeze-dried wooden artifacts by the authors yielded very small deformations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Currently used or proposed cathode recycling processes are multistep procedures which involve sequences of mechanical, thermal, and chemical leaching, where only the base material is recovered and significant processing is required to generate a recycled electrode structure. Another significant issue facing lithium based batteries is capacity fade due to structural degradation of the electroactive material upon extending cycling. Herein, inspired by heterogeneous catalyst thermal regeneration strategies, we present a new facile cathode recycling process, where previously used cathodes are removed from a cell, heat treated, and then inserted into a new cell restoring the delivered capacity and cycle life. An environmentally sustainable manganese based material is employed, where binder-free self-supporting (BFSS) electrodes are prepared using a fibrous, high aspect ratio manganese oxide active material. After 200 discharge charge cycles, the recycled BFSS electrodes display restored crystallinity and oxidation state of the manganese centers with the resulting electrochemistry (capacity and coulombic efficiency) reminiscent of freshly prepared BFSS cathodes. Notably, the BFSS electrode structure is robust with no degradation during the cell disassembly, electrode recovery, washing, and heat treatment steps; thus no post processing is required for the recycled electrode. This work shows for the first time that a thermal regeneration method previously employed in catalyst systems can fully restore battery electrochemical performance, demonstrating a novel electrode recycling process which could open up new possibilities for energy storage devices with extended electrode lifecycles.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Development and application of a novel screening method and experimental use of the mutant bacterial strain Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 for production of butanol via fermentation of fresh cassava","Abstract":"Classic chemical mutagenesis has a demonstrated potential to create a strain of Clostridium with improved fermentation performance for obtaining high butanol yield.

In this paper, a simple, novel screening method to select target strains by using trypan blue dye as an indicator in solid starch media to detect the target mutant bacterium was devised. A well performing mutant strain Clostridium beijerinckii no. 15 was obtained using this screening method. It was derived from wild-type C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 by N-methyl-N '-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) mutagenesis, and its fermentative capability for producing butanol was investigated, using hydrolysate of fresh cassava and other substrates. The mutant strain C. beijerinckii no. 15 produced a maximum yield of 15.06 g L-1 butanol and 23.78 g L-1 total solvents, when the fresh cassava substrate was given a simple pretreatment at 121 degrees C for 1 h. For other substrates, the highest butanol yields: 20.67 g L-1 from glucose, 17.96 g L-1 from liquefied dextrin, and 13.59 g L-1 from liquefied corn powder (P <= 0.05) were also achieved. Experimental trials showed that the mutant strain had a significantly greater fermentation ability, and produced a high-yield butanol from fresh cassava hydrolysates. Further research showed that the highest overall yield of butanol resulted from the improvement of enzymatic activity of C. beijerinckii no. 15 ' s alpha-amylase (P <= 0.05). Also, the protein structure of the alpha-amylase was predicted and its amino acid mutation sites were analyzed. Results revealed that these mutant amino acids may have somehow improved alpha-amylase activity and thus, led to producing more butanol.

It was found that different fibre types and dosages require different moisture contents. It is concluded that low cement content (less than 300 kg\/m(3)) steel-fibre-reinforced roller-compacted concrete (SFR-RCC) mixes do not have sufficient paste and are prone to fibre agglomeration, hence SFR-RCC mixes richer in paste and at optimum moisture content are recommended. Mixes with cement content of 300 kg\/m(3) coped better with fibre reinforcement.

Nevertheless, the direct electrospinning of fibers into controllable three-dimensional (3D) architectures is still a nascent technology. Here, we apply near-field electrospinning (NFES) to directly write arbitrarily shaped 3D structures through consistent and spatially controlled fiber-by-fiber stacking of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibers. An element central to the success of this 3D electrospinning is the use of a printing paper placed on the grounded conductive plate and acting as a fiber collector. Once deposited on the paper, residual solvents from near-field electrospun fibers can infiltrate the paper substrate, enhancing the charge transfer between the deposited fibers and the ground plate via the fibrous network within the paper. Such charge transfer grounds the deposited fibers and turns them into locally fabricated electrical poles, which attract subsequent in-flight fibers to deposit in a self-aligned manner on top of each other. This process enables the design and controlled fabrication of electrospun 3D structures such as grids, walls, hollow cylinders, and other 3D logos.

In contrast, the concave bending device exhibited better field emission properties than the flat device; nevertheless, its field emission properties decreased as the concave bending radius reduced below a certain value. The method achieved two successes. One is that the interfacial interaction between CNT films and the flexible substrate was greatly enhanced. The other is that the transfer process improved the field emission properties due to the increase of vertically aligned CNT tips. Compared with traditional methods applied in FED preparation, the novel modified transfer method is organic free, easy to control, cheap, and environment friendly.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Organic Molecular Films as Light-Emitting and Light-Confining Material in Rolled-Up AlInP Semiconductor Microtube Resonators","Abstract":"A hybrid inorganic\/organic microcavity system is presented in which an AlInP-based rolled-up microtube resonator is combined with a thin film of naphthyl end-capped bithiophene molecules. The film is laterally structured into stripes on top of the AlInP layer system before the roll-up process. During the process, the strained bilayer together with the organic molecular stripes rolls up, and a hybrid microtube is formed. The stripes act as visible-light emitters inside the otherwise passive microtube. Furthermore, they induce a light confinement in the axial direction of the microtube, additional to the radial and azimuthal confinement that is intrinsic to a microtube. As the organic material defines the cavity and represents the emitter at the same time, an efficient light coupling into the three-dimensionally confined optical modes of the microtube resonator is ensured. The hybrid microtubes open up the opportunity for novel experiments on the light molecule interaction as well as their application in optical components.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Evaluation of a conducting interpenetrating network based on gum ghatti-g-poly(acrylic acid-aniline) as a colon-specific delivery system for amoxicillin trihydrate and paracetamol","Abstract":"The objective of the present investigation was to develop colon-specific drug delivery systems for amoxicillin trihydrate and paracetamol using Gum ghatti (Gg) based cross-linked hydrogels. An interpenetrating network (IPN) of electrically active hydrogel based on Gg, poly(acrylic acid) (AA) and polyaniline was synthesized by a two-step aqueous polymerization. The radical copolymerization of Gg and AA was done using N, N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide (MBA) and ammonium persulphate (APS) as a crosslinker-initiator system. Optimum operating conditions for maximizing the percentage swelling were solvent (ml) = 10, AA (mol L-1) = 0.291 x 10(-3), APS (mol L-1) = 0.219 x 10(-1), MBA (mol L-1) = 0.324 x 10(-1), reaction time (min) = 180, temperature (1C) = 60 and pH = 7.0. The synthesized semi-IPN matrix was further grafted with aniline through oxidative-radical copolymerization using APS in acidic media. The resultant cross-linked hydrogels were characterized using X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ToF-SIMS and electrical conductivity. The maximum conductivity was found to be 2.5 x 10(-6) S cm(-1) at 1.5 N HCl concentration. The synthesized hydrogels were loaded with amoxicillin trihydrate and paracetamol as model drugs to investigate the release behaviour. Amoxicillin trihydrate follows the surface phenomena and weak bonding interaction whereas paracetamol exhibited chemical interaction with the hydrogel matrices. The release rate of both the drugs through the synthesized hydrogel matrices was found to show Fickian behaviour at each pH. The hydrogel networks showed lower release in acidic and neutral media than in basic media, making them particularly suitable carriers for colon-specific drug delivery.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Highly selective acetaldehyde sensor using sol-gel dip coated nano crystalline TiO2 thin film","Abstract":"Nano crystalline titania thin film was prepared by sol-gel dip coating method and its acetaldehyde gas sensing characteristics has been discussed.

The effects of initial dye concentration, bioadsorbent dosage, contact time, solution pH value, temperature, ionic strength and surfactant content on the adsorption capacity of the bioadsorbent were investigated. The maximum adsorption capacities of the bioadsorbent for both AB93 and MB were 1372 mg g(-1) at an initial concentration of 2500 mg L-1. The conditions dependent adsorption characteristics of the bioadsorbent indicated a high efficiency of dyes removal. The appropriate isotherm model for the equilibrium process was the Freundlich, and the kinetic studies revealed that the adsorption of AB93 and MB followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The adsorbent behaviors were dominated by the electrostatic interactions between the bioadsorbents and the dye molecules. Moreover, the recyclability experiments showed that the bioadsorbent could be reused for at least three cycles with stable adsorption capacity even in complex systems containing binary dyes, salt, and surfactant Thus, the cellulose based bioadsorbent can be effectively used for the removal of dyes from industrial textile wastewater.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"PEG\/heparin-decorated lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles for long-circulating drug delivery","Abstract":"The clinical success of lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) for effective targeted drug delivery is still hindered by their rapid clearance from the bloodstream. In this work, a novel strategy for surface modification of LPHNPs with combined polyethylene glycol (PEG) and heparin (HEP) was developed to achieve a significant prolongation in blood circulation. All the LPHNPs formulated with a diameter of 100-200 nm were prepared by a modified w\/o\/w solvent diffusion\/evaporation method and physicochemically characterized. The synergistic action of PEG and HEP was observed, as combinatorial modification significantly improved the surface hydrophilicity as well as the suspension stability of nanoparticles and tailored the surface charge close to neutrality, in comparison to LPHNPs surface-treated with PEG or HEP alone. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that the PEG\/HEP coating significantly prohibited the macrophage uptake and extended the blood circulation of LPHNPs with concomitant reduced liver sequestration. The in vitro phagocytosis results using murine peritoneal macrophages showed 8.2-fold reduction compared to the control LPHNP group. The in vivo study in ICR mice showed PEG\/HEP coating increased the blood circulation half-life of LPHNPs from 0.3 h to 72.6 h. Moreover, PEG\/HEP LPHNPs exhibited dramatically reduced liver accumulation when compared to LPHNPs. These results demonstrated that PEG\/HEP LPHNPs with optimized particle size, surface hydrophilicity and surface charge, have a promising potential as long-circulating drug delivery systems.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Adhesion between highly stretchable materials","Abstract":"Recently developed high-speed ionic devices require adherent laminates of stretchable and dissimilar materials, such as gels and elastomers. Adhesion between stretchable and dissimilar materials also plays important roles in medicine, stretchable electronics, and soft robots. Here we develop a method to characterize adhesion between materials capable of large, elastic deformation. We apply the method to measure the debond energy of elastomer-hydrogel bilayers. The debond energy between an acrylic elastomer and a polyacrylamide hydrogel is found to be about 0.5 J m(-2), independent of the thickness and the crosslink density of the hydrogel. This low debond energy, however, allows the bilayer to be adherent and highly stretchable, provided that the hydrogel is thin and compliant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nanoparticles applied at the interface can improve adhesion between the elastomer and the hydrogel.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Printed dielectric-based organic diodes and transistors","Abstract":"Inkjet and other forms of printing are now popular deposition techniques for the various layers in organic electronic devices, which are crucial for the development of large-scale, low-cost, and flexible electronics.

Here, other binder systems were evaluated, polyacrylic acid (PAAH) mixed with CMC, CMC in buffered solution at pH 3 and amylopectin. However CMC showed the better performance in terms of cycle life of the electrode. Whatever the binder, cycle life decreases with increasing the active mass loading, which is attributed to both the precipitation of liquid electrolyte degradation products and to the loss of electrical contacts within the composite electrode and with the current collector as a consequence of the active particles volume variations. Furthermore, calendaring the electrode unfortunately decreases the cycle life. The rate performance was studied as a function of the active mass loading and was shown to be determined by the electrode polarization resistance. Finally, full cells cycling tests with Li1Ni1\/3Co1\/3Mn1\/3O2 at the positive electrode were done. 60% of the capacity is retained after 200 cycles at the surface capacity of 2.7 mAh cm(-2).

Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a series of solid, phase-pure metal phosphide nanoparticles (NPs) (Ni2P, Rh2P, and Pd3P) utilizing commercially available, air-stable metal phosphine complexes in a one-pot reaction. This single-source molecular precursor route provides an alternative method to access metal phosphide NPs with controlled phases and without the formation of metal NP intermediates that can lead to hollow particles. The formation of the Ni2P NPs was shown to proceed through an amorphous Ni-P intermediate, leading to the desired NP morphology and metal-rich phase. This low-temperature, rapid route to well-defined metal NPs is expected to have broad applicability to a variety of readily available or easily synthesized metal phosphine complexes with high decomposition temperatures. Hydrodeoxygenation of acetic acid, an abundant bio-oil component, was performed to investigate H-2 activation and deoxygenation pathways under conditions that are relevant to ex situ catalytic fast pyrolysis (high temperatures, low pressures, and near-stoichiometric H-2 concentrations). The catalytic performance of the silica-supported metal phosphide NPs was compared to the analogous incipient wetness (IW) metal and metal phosphide catalysts over the range 200-500 degrees C. Decarbonylation was the primary pathway for H-2 incorporation in the presence of all of the catalysts except NP-Pd3P, which exhibited minimal productive activity, and IW-Ni, which evolved H-2. The highly controlled NP-Ni2P and NP-Rh2P catalysts, which were stable under these conditions, behaved comparably to the IW-metal phosphides, with a slight shift to higher product onset temperatures, likely due to the presence of surface ligands. Most importantly, the NP-Ni2P catalyst exhibited H-2 activation and incorporation, in contrast to IW-Ni, indicating that the behavior of the metal phosphide is significantly different from that of the parent metal, and more closely resembles that of noble metal catalysts.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Mucoadhesive Buccal Tablets Based on Chitosan\/Gelatin Microparticles for Delivery of Propranolol Hydrochloride","Abstract":"Propranolol administration through buccal route offers some distinct advantages thanks to the easy access to the oral mucosa, fast onset of action, and avoidance of hepatic and intestinal degradation mechanisms. To overcome the effective removal existing in the buccal cavity, mucoadhesive delivery systems are considered a promising approach as they facilitate a close contact with the buccal mucosa. The aim of this study was to prepare mucoadhesive tablets based on chitosan\/gelatin microparticles for buccal delivery of propranolol hydrochloride. Spray-dried microparticles were prepared with different chitosan-gelatin weight ratios and characterized in terms of yield and morphology. Microparticles were subsequently compressed with the drug to obtain loaded buccal tablets. In vitro water uptake, mucoadhesion, release, and permeation tests were performed to investigate tablet ability to hydrate, to adhere to the mucosa, and to deliver drug through buccal mucosa. Microparticles showed a different morphology based on the different chitosan-gelatin weight ratios. Moreover, buccal tablets based on the prepared microparticles showed different technological and functional characteristics in virtue of their composition.

Further information on the interaction of neutral fluorenes within the phospholipid bilayer was obtained by an infrared (IR) spectroscopic study of films of DMPC and of the phospholipid with PFO deuterated specifically on its alkyl chains (DMPC-PFO-d(34)). This was complemented by measurements of the effect of F, TF and two neutral polymers: polyfluorene poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl), PFO, and poly(9,9-di-n-dodecylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl), PFD, on the phospholipid phase transition temperature using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Changes in liposome size upon addition of F and PFO were followed by dynamic light scattering. In addition, the spectroscopic properties of F, TF, PFO and PFD solubilised in DMPC liposomes (absorption, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence) were compared with those of the same probes in typical organic solvents (chloroform, cyclohexane and ethanol). Combining the insight from MD simulations with the results at the molecular level from the various experimental techniques suggests that while the small molecules have a tendency to be located in the phospholipid head group region, the polymers are incorporated within the lipid bilayers, with the backbone predominantly orthogonal to the phospholipid alkyl chains and with interdigitation of them and the PFO alkyl chains.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"A carboxymethyl cellulose modified magnetic bentonite composite for efficient enrichment of radionuclides","Abstract":"The radio-frequency (RF) plasma-induced grafting technique was employed to fabricate a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) grafted magnetic bentonite composite (CMC-g-MB) in Ar conditions.

Here, we studied the effects of alkyl chain length and unsaturation of neutral and negatively-charged phospholipids on the physicochemical properties of LNs. Three neutral phospholipids, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and distearoylphosphatidylcholine, having different alkyl chain lengths, were compared. The mean particle size of the LNs increased with the alkyl chain length, while the concentration of the drug entrapped in the LNs decreased. The particle size of all of the LNs could be maintained at less than 100nm for 1 month in cool and dark conditions, with the LNs with longer alkyl chain lipids showing greater stability. In the unsaturated phospholipids, the double bond in the alkyl chain of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and dierucoylphosphatidylcholine did not affect the physicochemical properties of the LNs. The negatively-charged phospholipids dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol and distearoylphosphatidylglycerol were also compared; LNs with longer alkyl chain lipids had larger particle sizes and lower drug concentrations, similar to the results for neutral phospholipids. We concluded that although some changes in physicochemical properties were observed among LNs with different phospholipid alkyl chain lengths, this methodology was general.

Pure GF samples were tested for their morphology, chemistry, and mechanical integrity. GF mimics the microstructure of Ni-F while individual bones of GF were hollow, because of the complete removal of nickel. The GF-PDMS composites were tested for their ability to sense both compressive and bending strains in the form of change in electrical resistance. The composite showed different sensitivity to bending and compression. Upon applying a 30% compressive strain on the GF-PDMS composite, its resistance increased to similar to 120% of its original value. Similarly, bending a sample to a radius of 1 mm caused the composite to change its resistance to similar to 52% of its original resistance value. The relative change in resistance of the composite by an applied pressure\/strain can be tuned to considerably different values by heat-treating the GF at different temperatures prior to infusing PDMS into its scaffold. Upon heat treating the GF at 800 degrees C prior to PDMS infusion, the GF-PDMS demonstrated similar to 10 times better sensitivity than the untreated sample for a compressive strain of 20%.

However, one obvious problem for practical applications is the usage of CO\/H-2 safe gas, which must be supplied to maintain the electrode performance. This work reports a safe gas free ceramic electrode for efficient CO2\/H2O electrolysis. The electrode has a heterogeneously porous structure with Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6-delta (SFM) electrocatalyst nanoparticles deposited onto the inner surface of the YSZ scaffold fabricated by a modified phase-inversion tape-casting method. The nanostructured SFM-YSZ electrodes have demonstrated excellent performance for CO2-H2O electrolysis. For example, the electrode polarization resistance is 0.25 Omega cm(2) under open circuit conditions while the current density is 1.1 A cm(-2) at 1.5 V for dry CO2 electrolysis at 800 degrees C. The performance is comparable with those reported for the Ni-YSZ fuel electrodes, where safe gas must be supplied. In addition, the performance is up to one order of magnitude better than those reported for other ceramic electrodes such as La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta and La0.2Sr0.8TiO3+delta. Furthermore, the electrode exhibits good stability in the short-term test at 1.3 V for CO2-20 vol% H2O co-electrolysis, which produces a syngas with a H-2\/CO ratio close to 2. The reduced interfacial polarization resistance, high current density, and good stability show that the nanostructured SFM-YSZ fuel electrode is highly effective for CO2\/H2O electrolysis without using the safe gas, which is critical for practical applications.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Enhancement of capacitive deionization capacity of hierarchical porous carbon","Abstract":"Capacitive deionization (CDI) has attracted huge interest as an energy-efficient and eco-friendly desalination strategy. Its development is presently limited due to the relatively low CDI capacitances of carbon materials. Herein, hierarchical porous carbon materials (HPCs) derived from ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) upon annealing were used, which showed impressive CDI performance with a maximum desalination capacity of 34.27 mg g(-1) in 40 mg L-1 NaCl aqueous solution. Such capability was attributed to the appropriate hierarchical pore structure, high specific surface area (2185.71 m(2) g(-1)), large pore volume (1.368 cm(3) g(-1)) and reasonable graphitization degree, which were also confirmed by the high specific capacitances of 182 F g(-1) in 1 mol L-1 NaCl and 260 F g(-1) in 6 mol L-1 KOH. Since the physisorption capacity was nearly 0, and the regeneration process was facile and complete, such economical HPCs materials show potential for practical desalination applications in the future. Moreover, the HPCs electrodes presented ion selectivity in competitive multi-ionic solutions by kinetic behavior difference or static capacitance difference.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Core-Shell Structured Biopolymer@BaTiO3 Nanoparticles for Biopolymer Nanocomposites with Significantly Enhanced Dielectric Properties and Energy Storage Capability","Abstract":"Flexible high-dielectric-constant (high-kappa) nanocomposite dielectrics comprising polymer matrix and ceramic nanoparticles have important applications in the fields of electrical insulation and energy storage. However, most of the flexible high-kappa nanocomposites are fabricated by using nonbiodegradable polymers as matrixes, which may not meet the increasing demands of society for environmental sustainability. In this study, using biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) as a matrix and core-shell structured BaTiO3 (BT) nanoparticles as high-kappa filler, we report the preparation and structure property relationship of environmentally friendly flexible high-kappa polymer nanocomposites. Two types of core shell structured high-kappa nanoparticles [polydopamine-encapsulated BT (BT@PDA) and PLA-encapsulated BT@PDA (BT@PDA@PLA)] as well as as-prepared BT nanoparticles were used as filler of the PLA-based high-kappa nanocomposites. It was found that, compared with the as-prepared BT nanocomposites, the core shell nanoparticle-based composites show enhanced dielectric constant, suppressed dielectric loss tangent, and enhanced breakdown strength. In addition, the BT@PDA@PLA nanocomposites have much higher dielectric constant and energy density. The nanoparticle-PLA compatibility and its influence on the dielectric and energy storage properties of the nanocomposites were also investigated. Because the polymer matrix is environmentally friendly and the preparation process of the core-shell nanoparticles is facile and nontoxic, the nanocomposites reported here may be used in the next generation of environmentally friendly high-performance energy storage devices.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Polymer-DNA Molecular Net for Selective Transportation of Target Biomolecules and Inhibition of Tumor Growth","Abstract":"We demonstrate a new concept of a molecular net for capturing, release, and transportation of target molecules by utilizing polymer-based DNA molecular net (PD-mn).

Their morphologies and gas-sensing properties were mainly studied. The different morphology was attributed to the different surfactants. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) played a key role in the formation of the single-crystalline nanoflower. Among all of above samples, the sensor based on nanoflower showed the highest response, shortest response\/recovery time and the most excellent selectivity to acetone under the optimal working temperature of 370 degrees C. The enhancement in acetone sensing properties was owed to flower-like hierarchical structure which could provide more gas diffusion ways. These results demonstrated that the ZnO nanoflower with PEG-assisted could be a good candidate for fabricating effective acetone sensors. In addition, a possible formation mechanism of nanoflowers and gas sensing mechanism were proposed, too. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, making biofuel economical from algal biomass requires the co-production of additional useful biochemical components that are unique to algae and that have a proven market value. A viable and sustainable biorefining technology that maximizes the utilisation of feedstock for the production of chemicals along with fuel is, therefore, indispensable. Here, we for the first time demonstrate a tractable integrated process that facilitates sequential extraction of the major components of red algal biomass as commodity products such as pigments, lipid, agar, minerals and energy dense substrate (cellulose). The computed yield data from small-scale biorefinery trials suggest that a ton of fresh biomass supplies several valuable extracts: 0.3-0.7 kg of R-phycoerythrin (R-PE), 0.1-0.3 kg of R-phycocyanin (R-PC), 1.2-4.8 kg of lipids, 28.4-94.4 kg of agar, 4.4-41.9 kg of cellulose and 3.1-3.6 kiloliters of mineral solution. The enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of cellulose thus obtained would yield 1.8-17.4 kg of ethanol. A distinct advantage of this process over direct extraction is the improved quality of agar (gel strength higher by 1.5-3 fold) without alkali and acid pretreatment of sample, the elimination of residue and the reduction by up to 85% in chemicals usage in cellulose extraction. The findings reported in this study forms the basis for starting new ocean-based bio-industries minimizing the dependence on the terrestrial resources for food, feed, energy and chemicals.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Properties comparison of mortars with welan gum or cellulose ether","Abstract":"Welan gum is a type of microbial polysaccharide by fermentation, that could be used as thickener in cement and concrete because of its performance of thicken and anti-bleeding. At present, the most popular thicker in cement and concrete is cellulose ether, especially hydroxy-propyl-methyl cellulose HPMC. This paper reports the different properties between mortars with welan gum or HPMC, as well as standing bleeding rate, mortar fluidity, compressive and adhesive strengths, microstructure by ESEM, rheological properties and electric properties by zeta potential. It was shown that, both welan gum and HPMC are good thickener; however, welan gum has a clear benefit at higher W\/C ratios as much less additive is needed. Both welan gum and HPMC meet adhesion requirements, but welan gum has negligible effect on compressive strength, whereas addition of HPMC results in a very substantial decrease of compressive strength. At high shear rates, mortar with welan gum has better stability than that with HPMC. In water, welan gum forms a three-dimensional threaded network whereas HPMC forms a foil. Under shear conditions, the HPMC foil breaks up beyond recovery, while the welan gum network instead crumples up and unfolds again when shear is removed. In addition, welan gum adsorbs better than HPMC, has greater influence on the zeta potential of cement clinker and changed its electric properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, on the basis of a study of mineralogical characteristics, the recovery of iron from CCS flotation tails using a combined process of magnetic separation and reverse flotation was investigated. The study revealed that CCS flotation tails are primarily composed of magnetite (21.49%) and iron silicates (72.52%). The iron content of CCS flotation tails is as high as 49.60%, while only 30.31% of the iron distributed in the magnetite and ferroalloy shows significant magnetic properties. Zeta-potential studies of magnetite, quartz and fayalite samples have shown that amines are well adsorbed, both on the surfaces of the magnetite and also on the surfaces of the iron silicates, within a pH range of 5-10. The iron content of CCS flotation tails can be effectively upgraded to 59.61% using magnetic separation Amines with different molecular structures performed different selectivity for iron silicates when reverse flotation was used to remove iron silicates from the magnetic concentrate. The use of mixtures of cationic and anionic collectors provided a formation of a stable hydrophobic adsorption layer on the surface of the iron silicates and magnetite silicate aggregates; this improved the flotation of these mineral particles, even in the presence of a starch, which acted as a depressant of Fe oxides. The scheme of combining magnetic separation and reverse flotation is a promising method to use to (a) recover iron and (b) produce iron concentrates with SiO2 content of 6.59% and Fe content of up to 63.35% from CCS flotation tails with SiO2 content as high as 36.40%.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Monitoring Network and Interfacial Healing Processes by Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy: A Case Study on Natural Rubber","Abstract":"Broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) is introduced as a new and powerful technique to monitor network and macroscale damage healing in an elastomer.

First, the MgAl-NO3 LDH was prepared by the hydrothermal method, then it was exfoliated into the positively charged nanosheet in the presence of formamide. Second, the coating deposition on cotton fabrics was carried out by alternately immersing the fabrics into MgAl-LDH suspension and alginate solution. In the vertical flame test, the cotton fabric coated with 20 bilayers could preserve almost 70% of the weave structure after the burning, while pure cotton fabric was completely burned out. The test by microscale combustion calorimetry revealed that the cotton fabrics only with 3.52 wt% coating could obtain 34.6% reduction in peak heat release rate and 25.6% reduction in total heat release compared with those of the pure one. In addition, as evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results, the decreased amount of volatilized pyrolysis products and toxic volatiles (CO) during the degradation of coated cotton fabrics was another important factor to improve the flame retardancy. The notable improved flame retardancy of coated cotton fabrics is attributed to the fact that the MgAl-LDH filled coating can form an inorganic protective layer, which can act as a barrier to retard the transfer of heat, oxygen, and the diffusion of volatilized pyrolysis products between the combustion zone and underlying cotton fibers.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Corn-like indium tin oxide nanostructures: fabrication, characterization and formation mechanism","Abstract":"Electrospinning is a simple but efficient procedure enabling the parallel fabrication of a multitude of inorganic fibers.

Here we show that in the fabrication of corn-like ITO NFs, the usage of different solvents N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and deionized water, as well as the calcination temperature, can also lead to dramatic morphology changes, from ribbon-like to cylindrical and then to corn-like. The resultant nanoribbons and nanoscale corn-like fibers exhibit different photoluminescence properties. We find that the morphology of the as-spun fibers is closely related to the vapor pressure of the solvent we used, and the generation of ITO crystals sensitively depends on the calcination temperature, which both are critical for the morphology and properties of the final products. Thus, we demonstrate that the formation of this unprecedented nanostructure is determined by the combined effect of the precursor chemical composition, solvent and calcination temperature.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Effective removal of Cr(VI) using beta-cyclodextrin-chitosan modified biochars with adsorption\/reduction bifuctional roles","Abstract":"In this work, beta-cyclodextrin-chitosan modified walnut shell biochars (beta-CCWB) were synthesized as a low-cost adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions.

The experimental data fitted a pseudo-second order equation and Freundlich isotherm model, and the optimum adsorption of the modified biochar was observed at pH 2.0 with an adsorption capacity of 206 mg g(-1).

Liver and brain are two important target organs in INH toxicity. However, the exact mechanisms behind the INH hepatotoxicity or neurotoxicity have not yet been completely understood. Considering the mitochondria as one of the possible molecular targets for INH toxicity, the aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanisms of INH mitochondrial toxicity on isolated mitochondria. Mitochondria were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation from male Sprague-Dawley rats and incubated with different concentrations of INH (25-2000 mu M) for the investigation of mitochondrial parameters. The results indicated that INH could interact with mitochondrial respiratory chain and inhibit its activity. Our results showed an elevation in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial membrane potential collapse after exposure of isolated liver mitochondria in INH. However, different results were obtained in brain mitochondria. Noteworthy, significant glutathione oxidation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion and lipid peroxidation were observed in higher concentration of INH, as compared to liver mitochondria. In conclusion, our results suggest that INH may initiate its toxicity in liver mitochondria through interaction with electron transfer chain, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane potential decline and cytochrome c expulsion which ultimately lead to cell death signaling.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"High-Energy-Density Lithium-Sulfur Batteries Based on Blade-Cast Pure Sulfur Electrodes","Abstract":"A facile pure sulfur electrode strategy is demonstrated to increase the areal loading of blade-cast sulfur electrodes and improve the electrochemical performances of thick sulfur electrodes with consideration for scale-up in practical, commercial applications. Benefiting from the unique pure sulfur electrode and an upper current collector design, the pure sulfur electrode displays low polarization, high sulfur utilization, and promising cycling stability even with an ultrahigh sulfur loading. A high areal capacity of 19.2 mAh cm(-2) has been achieved, which is the highest areal capacity for the reported blade-cast sulfur electrodes and 4 times higher than that of available lithium-ion battery electrodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the use of large-sized sulfur particles only slightly decreases the rate of conversion from S-8 to S-4(2-) during the initial discharge and has negligible impact on subsequent electrochemical performance.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Surface capacitive contributions: Towards high rate anode materials for sodium ion batteries","Abstract":"Due to the poor transportability of sodium ions, conventional sodium ion batteries (SIBs) cannot deliver sufficient capacity for high rate applications. Surface-induced capacitive processes (SCP) (e.g. capacitance and pseudocapacitance) could provide fast charge\/discharge capacity in conjunction with the capacity provided by diffusion-controlled intercalation processes (DIP) to address this issue. For the first time, SCP was used to design a hierarchical layered graphene composite as an anode material for high rate SIBs. The contributions of the individual sodium storage processes were quantitatively evaluated, verifying the proposed mechanism. The resultant SCP-enhanced SIB delivers an outstanding rate capacity of 120 mAh\/g at 10 A\/g, which is among best of the state-of-the-art carbon-based SIBs.

The culturing of fungi and study of their VOC emissions were performed in chromatographic vials at room temperature (23 - 24 degrees C) and the VOCs were sampled by a solid-phase microextraction on a 85 mu m carboxen\/polydimethylsiloxane fiber. GC\/MS was performed using a 60-m HP-5 capillary column. Components of the VOC mixture were identified by electron impact mass spectra and chromatographic retention indices (RIs). The most abundant components of the VOC mixture emitted by Fusarium fungi are EtOH, AcOH, (BuOH)-Bu-i, 3-methylbutan-1-ol, 2-methylbutan-1-ol, ethyl 3-methylbutanoate, terpenes with M 136, sesquiterpenes with M 204 (a total of about 25), and trichodiene. It was found that the strains grown on PSA emit a wider spectrum and larger amount of VOCs compared with those grown on wheat kernels. F. langsethiae strain is the most active VOC producer on both substrates.

Upon genipin cross-link, the cross-linked compound not only stabilizes the assembled nanostructures but also induces red fluorescence, which is promising as a fluorescent probe for cell imaging. The experimental data suggested that the emission of red fluorescence may result from the presence of carboxyl group in the compact, cross-linked micelles.

The NG nanosheets provide a large surface area to reduce self-aggregation and confine the shape of the Co2CuS4 NPs for a highly conductive network to boost the charge transport properties of energy storage devices.

It was found that the residue yield decreased with increasing hydrothermal carbonization temperature while the yield of total soluble products (WSP and ASP) was nearly the same. The residue and total soluble products yields had no large changes in the pH range of 4.0-10.0, but fewer residues and more total soluble products were obtained at pH 13.0.

The higher heating values (HHVs) of residues were in the ranges of 22.0 to 28.2 MJ kg(-1) at temperatures from 180 to 260 inverted perpendicular C and pH from 4.0 to 10.0. The HHVs of these residues could be comparable with those of some commercial coals, such as lignite. However, the HI-IVs of residues decreased when the pH reached to 13.0.

A difference in the fiber failure mechanism is identified based on the strain rate. CNFs show signs of deformation along their entire length under quasi-static compression. In contrast, the high-strain rate failure results in rupture of outer turbostratic carbon layers, leading to stress transfer to the inner graphite layers. The graphitic layers elongate and rupture, forming a conical tip at the fracture cross section of the CNFs. The strength of nanocomposites at high strain rate is measured to be up to 180 % higher depending on the composite composition and strain rate. CNFs substantially increase the localized plastic deformation of the matrix under quasi-static compression and result in nanoscale deformation features on the failure surface. The observed higher strength and modulus of nanocomposites at high strain rates are attributed to the difference in the matrix and fiber failure mechanisms at different strain rates.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Removal of barium from radioactive aqueous solution by PVA-alginate encapsulated titanium oxide using sunlight and other light types","Abstract":"Barium(II) removal with titania PVA-alginate beads was conducted with sunlight, xenon, black light bulb (BLB) and light emitting diode (LED) lamps.

Given their rapid tunable reaction rate and highly fluorogenic properties, tetrazine bioorthogonal reactions have come to be considered highly attractive tools for elucidating biological functions and messages in vitro and in vivo. In this chapter, we present recent advances expanding the scope of precursor reactivity and we introduce new biomedical methodology based on bioorthogonal tetrazine chemistry. We specifically highlight novel applications for different kinds of biomolecules, including nucleic acid, protein, antibodies, lipids, glycans, and bioactive small molecules, in the areas of imaging, detection, and diagnostics. We also briefly present other recently developed inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder bioorthogonal reactions. Lastly, we consider future directions and potential roles that inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder reactions may play in the fields of bioorthogonal and biomedical chemistry.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Copy, Edit, and Paste: Natural Product Approaches to Biomaterials and Neuroengineering","Abstract":"CONSPECTUS: Progress in the chemical sciences has formed the world we live in, both on a macroscopic and on a nanoscopic scale. The last century witnessed the development of high performance materials that interact with humans on many layers, from clothing to construction, from media to medical devices. On a molecular level, natural products and their derivatives influence many biological processes, and these compounds have enormously contributed to the health and quality of living of humans. Although coatings of stone materials with oils or resins (containing natural products) have led to improved tools already millennia ago, in contrast today, natural product approaches to designer materials, that is, combining the best of both worlds, remain scarce. In this Account, we will summarize our recent research efforts directed to the generation of natural product functionalized materials, exploiting the strategy of \"copy, edit, and paste with natural products\". Natural products embody the wisdom of evolution, and only total synthesis is able to unlock the secrets enshrined in their molecular structure. We employ total synthesis (\"copy\") as a scientific approach to address problems related to molecular structure, the biosynthesis of natural products, and their bioactivity. Additionally, the fundamental desire to investigate the mechanism of action of natural products constitutes a key driver for scientific inquiry. In an emerging area of relevance to society, we have prepared natural products such as militarinone D that can stimulate neurite outgrowth and facilitate nerve regeneration. This knowledge obtained by synthetic organic chemistry on complex natural products can then be used to design structurally simplified compounds that retain the biological power of the parent natural product (\"edit\"). This process, sometimes referred to as function-oriented synthesis, allows obtaining derivatives with better properties, improving their chemical tractability and reducing the step count of the synthesis. Along these lines, we have demonstrated that militarinone D can be truncated to yield structurally simplified analogs with improved activity. Finally, with the goal of designing bioactive materials, we have immobilized functionally optimized, neuritogenic natural products (\"paste\"). These materials could facilitate nerve regeneration, act as nerve guidance conduits, or lead to new approaches in neuroengineering. Based on the surface-adhesive properties of electron-deficient catecholates and the knowledge gathered on neuritogenic natural product derivatives, two mechanistically different design principles have been applied to generate neuritogenic materials. In conclusion, natural products, and their functionally optimized analogs, present a large, mostly untapped reservoir of powerful modulators of biological systems, and their hybridization with materials can lead to new approaches in various fields, from biofilm prevention to neuroengineering.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Multifunctional biosensor based on self-assembled multi-walled carbon nanotubes sponge","Abstract":"In this work, self-assembled multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) sponge constructed by ice-templating method synergizes the advantages of MWCNTs and organic polymers chitosan (CS) for biosensing applications.

Novel three-dimensional (3D) open-celled carbon scaffold (CS and CS-GR) anodes were prepared by carbonizing the microcellular polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and PAN\/graphite composites (PAN-GR), which were obtained by means of foaming by using supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO2) as a physical foaming agent. The two anodes as well as the conventional carbon felt anode were assembled in MFCs based on Escherichia coli (E. coli). The improved performance of the CS anode is ascribed to the remaining -C=N group resulting in considerably improved hydrophilicity and biocompatibility after carbonization and the 3D open-celled scaffold structure contributing to the substrate transfer and internal colonization of E. coli bacteria. Meanwhile, the superior performance of the CS-GR anode is mainly attributed to the increased specific surface area and active reaction area resulting from the addition of graphite. This work provides an effective method to develop a 3D open-celled biocompatible CS-GR anode, which facilitates the extracellular electron transfer for high-performance MFCs that are promising for practical applications on a large scale.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Performance of different advanced oxidation processes for tertiary wastewater treatment to remove the pesticide acetamiprid","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: This work studied the performance of different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) as tertiary treatment for removal of the pesticide acetamiprid from water. Specifically, UV, UV\/TiO2, UV\/H2O2\/Fe, and two systems with persulfate (PS), UV\/PS and UV\/PS\/Fe, were evaluated. RESULTS: The study was carried out in deionised water, synthetic water from a secondary effluent and real effluent from a conventional activated sludge effluent (CAS effluent). In addition, the effect of humic acids, lignin-derivative and lauryl sulphate was investigated as organic matter that affects AOP efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Photo-Fenton at natural pH proved to be the most efficient process in all matrices. The persulfate systems have also shown that they have great potential for micropollutant removal. It was found that humic acids reduced degradation efficiency for UV\/H2O2\/Fe and UV\/PS\/Fe due to competition with radicals. Humic acids had a negative impact on UV photolysis at high concentration due to the absorptivity of UV light. Lignin had a negative effect on AOPs that used iron, forming Fe(II)-complexes with high absorptivity which act as a light filter. For lauryl sulphate, its chemical structure did not favour the formation of iron complexes at natural pH, resulting in similar degradation rates for UV\/H2O2\/Fe, UV\/H2O2, UV\/PS and UV\/PS\/Fe.

The absence of in-depth knowledge about the effects of screen size throughout the biochemical conversion of cellulosic biomass makes it difficult to choose the screen size to conduct biomass size reduction to minimize the energy consumption on mills, maximize the cellulose recovery rate after pretreatment, and maximize the enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency. The objective of this work is to address this issue by generating new knowledge on the effects of screen size in these three processes: size reduction, pretreatment, and enzymatic hydrolysis in conversion of big bluestem biomass for biofuel production. Four screen sizes used in this study were 1, 2, 4, and 8 mm. It was found that using a larger screen size saved energy in biomass size reduction on a knife mill. Moreover, particles produced with larger screen sizes achieved higher cellulose recovery rate after pretreatment, higher enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency, and higher total sugar yield.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"A Nanopore-Structured Nitrogen-Doped Biocarbon Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction from Two-Step Carbonization of Lemna minor Biomass","Abstract":"So far, the development of highly active and stable carbon-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to replace commercial Pt\/C catalyst is a hot topic. In this study, a new nanoporous nitrogen-doped carbon material was facilely designed by two-step pyrolysis of the renewable Lemna minor enriched in crude protein under a nitrogen atmosphere. Electrochemical measurements show that the onset potential for ORR on this carbon material is around 0.93 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode), slightly lower than that on the Pt\/C catalyst, but its cycling stability is higher compared to the Pt\/C catalyst in an alkaline medium. Besides, the ORR at this catalyst approaches to a four-electron transfer pathway. The obtained ORR performance can be basically attributed to the formation of high contents of pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen atoms inside this catalyst. Thus, this work opens up the path in the ORR catalysis for the design of nitrogen-doped carbon materials utilizing aquatic plants as starting precursors.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Fabrication of high power LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 battery cathodes by nanostructuring of electrode materials","Abstract":"Using nanoparticles, instead of microparticles, as active electrode materials in lithium ion batteries could provide a solution to slow charging rates due to long ion diffusion pathways in conventional bulk materials. In this work, we present a new strategy for the synthesis of high purity lithium nickel manganese oxide (LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4) nanoparticles as a high-voltage cathode. A sonochemical reaction is used to synthesize nickel hydroxide and manganese dioxide nanoparticles followed by a solid-state reaction with lithium hydroxide. The product shows a single spinel phase and uniform spherical nano-particles under the appropriate calcination conditions. The LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 exhibits a high voltage plateau at about 4.7-4.9 V in the charge\/discharge process and delivers a discharge capacity of more than 140 mA h g(-1) and excellent cycling performance with 99% capacity retention after 70 cycles. The synthesized nano-particles show improved electrochemical performance at high rates. This electrode delivers a power density as high as 26.1 kW kg(-1) at a discharge rate of 40 C. This power performance is about one order ofmagnitude higher than traditional lithium ion batteries. These findings may lead to a new generation of high power lithiumion batteries that can be recharged in minutes instead of hours.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Cupreous Complex-Loaded Chitosan Nanoparticles for Photothermal Therapy and Chemotherapy of Oral Epithelial Carcinoma","Abstract":"Electron transition materials on the basis of transition metal ions usually possess higher photothermal transduction efficiency but lower extinction ability, which have not been considered as efficient photothermal agents for therapeutic applications. In this work, we demonstrate a facile and feasible approach for enhancing 808 nm photothermal conversion effect of d orbits transition Cu(II) ions by forming Cu-carboxylate complexes. The coordination with carboxylate groups greatly enlarges the splitting energy gap of Cu(II) and the capability of electron transition, thus enhancing the extinction ability in near-infrared region. The cupreous complexes are further loaded in biocompatible and biodegradable polymer nanoparticles (NPs) of chitosan to temporarily lower the toxicity, which allows the photothermal therapy of human oral epithelial carcinoma (KB) cells in vitro and KB tumors in vivo. Animal experiments indicate the photothermal tumor inhibition rate of 100%. In addition, the gradual degradation of chitosan NPs leads to the release of cupreous complexes, thus exhibiting additional chemotherapeutic behavior in KB tumor treatment. Onefold chemotherapy experiments indicate the tumor inhibition rate of 93.1%. The combination of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy of cupreous complex-loaded chitosan NPs indicates the possibility of inhibiting tumor recurrence.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Highly stable copper wire\/alumina\/polyimide composite films for stretchable and transparent heaters","Abstract":"Transparent heaters, which are capable of withstanding a high dynamic strain, in contrast with those made of brittle indium tin oxide films, are increasingly needed for heating of next-generation flexible and stretchable electronics, such as artificial skins, touch screens, displays, and sensors. This work provides a new approach for the fabrication of a transparent heater that is made of a Cu wire\/alumina\/polyimide composite film. The advantages of this film include a high transparency, low operating voltage, unprecedented stability against harsh environmental conditions, and repeated bending or stretching. A highly conductive Cu wire network was prepared via thermal evaporation of low-cost Cu on electrospun polymer nanofibers. Atomic layer deposition was used to conformably deposit an alumina film on the Cu wire network to suppress the diffusion and oxidation of Cu. The solution casted polyimide film that was introduced acts as a binder and can successfully improve the adhesion strength between the Cu wire and its substrate. After delicate optimization of the layered structure, we fabricated a transparent heater that exhibits a low sheet resistance of 8 Omega sq(-1) and a high visible light transmittance of up to 91.4%, and it demonstrated an unprecedented ability to resist temperatures as high as 300 degrees C. Furthermore, the Cu wire\/alumina\/polyimide-based transparent heater can endure 100 cycles of stretching-releasing at a strain of 30% with an exceptionally high stability and reversibility. Thus, these copper wire\/alumina\/polyimide composite films have extremely high potential for applications in heating of future wearable optoelectronic devices.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Nanoporous electrospun PB-PVDF composite nanofibers and their electrocatalytic activity toward ascorbic acid","Abstract":"Creating a facile method that can improve the stability of Prussian blue (PB) in neutral and weak alkaline has proved extremely challenging.

Because adsorption is the first step for all other processes (protection against degradation and polymerization), it is important that it is performed under conditions that existed on prebiotic Earth. In this paper, we use an artificial seawater (seawater 4.0 Ga), which contains major cations and anions that could present on the oceans of the prebiotic Earth. In addition, zeolites, with substituted Fe in the framework, and adenine were probably common substances on the prebiotic Earth. Thus, study the interaction between them is an important issue in prebiotic chemistry. There are two main findings described in this paper. Firstly, zeolites with different Si\/Fe ratios adsorbed adenine differently. Secondly, XAFS showed that, after treatments with seawater 4.0 Ga and adenine, an increase in the complexity of the system occurred. In general, salts of seawater 4.0 Ga did not affect the adsorption of adenine onto zeolites and adenine adsorbed less onto zeolites with iron isomorphically substituted. The C=C and NH2 groups of adenine interacted with the zeolites. Gypsum, formed from aqueous species dissolved in seawater 4.0 Ga, precipitated onto zeolites. EPR spectra of zeolites showed lines caused by Fe framework and Fe3+ species. TG curves of zeolites showed events caused by loss of water weakly bound to zeolite (in the 30-140 degrees C range), water bounded to iron species or cations from seawater 4.0 Ga or located in the cavities of zeolites (157-268 degrees C) and degradation of adenine adsorbed onto zeolites (360-600 degrees C). Mass loss follows almost the same order as the amount of adenine adsorbed onto zeolites. The XAFS spectrum showed that Fe3+ could be substituted into the framework of the Fe-7-ZSM-5 zeolite.

Sonication, just for a few seconds, of the ground mixture in a suitable solvent\/mixed-solvent system finally results in the formation of a gel matrix. Citrazinic acid is decorated with ureidopyrimidone functionalities and melamine is enriched with aminopyridine functionalities. Therefore, the necessary non-covalent interactions (like hydrogen bonding and p-p stacking) become part-and-parcel of this reaction, bringing a nanofibrous gel material into existence. A thorough and complete solvent-dependent gelation investigation suggests that water must be present as the sole solvent or one of the members of other mixed-solvent systems to successfully result in gel formation. The gel shows an entangled network morphology. Different micro-analytical studies (FTIR, powder XRD, FESEM, TEM, rheology, etc.) have been conducted for complete characterization of the gel sample. The gel also exhibits stimuli-responsive behaviour towards different interfering chemical parameters like pH, selective anions, etc. Again, it is worth mentioning that here, GMP plays a key role in strongly initiating and improvising solid-state self-assembly. Different non-covalent interactions afford a suitable hydrogen-bonded motif which presumably propagates upon activation in solution phase after mild sonication, favouring the spontaneous formation of fibrous architectures. It is also noticed that without grinding, the solid-state interactions are jeopardized and only a partial gel structure prevails. Finally, the available porosity in the gel framework and the enriched p-electron density within the structure make the gel a suitable host for adsorption of guest molecules. This information provoked us to study the reversible adsorption-desorption equilibrium of molecular iodine within the dried-gel matrix. The guest iodine entrapment into the host occurs both from the solution and also from gas-phase iodine. The complete analysis suggests that our material presents a high storage capacity for this halogen species. Therefore, the study prescribes that the synthesized hydrogel material could be a suitable candidate for application in synthetic organic chemistry and would find an avenue to solve other environmental issues also.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Scalable synthesis of nanometric alpha-Fe2O3 within interconnected carbon shells from pyrolytic alginate chelates for lithium storage","Abstract":"Nanostructured alpha-Fe2O3 with a carbon coating has advantages over commercially available graphitic anodes in lithium ion batteries, including high theoretical anodic capacity (1007 mA h g(-1)), low cost and environmental safety. However, parts of its merits were cancelled out by the current route used for its synthesis. For example, most of its synthesis pathways are tedious, costly, on small scale and environmentally unfriendly. By combining two naturally abundant materials (iron ions and sodium alginate) into conventional wet-spinning and pyrolysis processes, we show that alpha-Fe2O3 could be nanostructured and carbon-coated using a facile and yet scalable technique. The successful synthesis of nanostructured alpha-Fe2O3 within interconnected carbon shells strongly depends on the chelation of iron ions and alginate into \"egg-box\" networks and an optimized pyrolysis step. Due to an extraordinary combination of nanometric scale, improved electrical conductivity and spatial confinement of the carbon coating, the resultant materials exhibit a high lithium storage capacity (e.g. up to similar to 1400 mA h g(-1) at a current of 50 mA g(-1) in the initial cycle) and great stability (e.g. similar to 560 mA h g(-1) after 600 cycles at 200 mA g(-1)) as well as a coulombic efficiency of 97.5%.

It relies on the construction of an electrostatic template by electrospinning a thin layer of fibers onto a micropatterned collector. Because the fibers cannot release their charges when they are suspended over cavities of the micropatterned collector, an electrostatic template is formed with repulsive and attractive domains. This electrostatic template is then used to guide precisely the particle deposition during the electrospraying step. Microstructured bi-layer composites with a great variety of micropatterns can thus be elaborated with any kind of materials allowing the use of the ETAD process for a wide range of applications.

Optical transparency is a crucial metric for silica aerogels in many solar related applications. Both scattering and absorption can reduce the amount of light transmitted through an aerogel slab. Due to multiple scattering, the transmittance deviates from the Beer-Lambert law (exponential attenuation). To better understand its optical performance, we decoupled and quantified the extinction contributions of absorption and scattering separately by identifying two sets of radiative properties. The radiative properties are deduced from the measured total transmittance and reflectance spectra (from 250 nm to 2500 nm) of synthesized aerogel samples by solving the inverse problem of the 1-D Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). The obtained radiative properties are found to be independent of the sample geometry and can be considered intrinsic material properties, which originate from the aerogel's microstructure. This finding allows for these properties to be directly compared between different samples. We also demonstrate that by using the obtained radiative properties, we can model the photon transport in aerogels of arbitrary shapes, where an analytical solution is difficult to obtain.

In particular, with exceptionally large specific surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and superior chemical\/electrochemical stability, graphene represents the ideal material for various electrochemical energy storage devices including supercapacitors. However, due to the strong pi-pi interaction between graphene sheets, the graphene flakes tend to restack to form graphite-like powders when they are processed into practical electrode materials, which can greatly reduce the specific surface area and lead to inefficient utilization of the graphene layers for electrochemical energy storage. The self-assembly of two-dimensional graphene sheets into three-dimensional (3D) framework structures can largely retain the unique properties of individual graphene sheets and has recently garnered intense interest for fundamental investigations and potential applications in diverse technologies. In this Account, we review the recent advances in preparing 3D graphene macrostructures and exploring them as a unique platform for supercapacitor applications. We first describe the synthetic strategies, in which reduction of a graphene oxide dispersion above a certain critical concentration can induce the reduced graphene oxide sheets to cross-link with each other via partial pi-pi stacking interactions to form a 3D interconnected porous macrostructure. Multiple reduction strategies, including hydrothermal\/solvothermal reduction, chemical reduction, and electrochemical reduction, have been developed for the preparation of 3D graphene macrostructures. The versatile synthetic strategies allow for easy incorporation of heteroatoms, carbon nanomaterials, functional polymers, and inorganic nanostructures into the macrostructures to yield diverse composites with tailored structures and properties. We then summarize the applications of the 3D graphene macrostructures for high-performance supercapacitors. With a unique framework structure in which the graphene sheets are interlocked in 3D space to prevent their restacking, the graphene macrostructures feature very high specific surface areas, rapid electron and ion transport, and superior mechanical strength. They can thus be directly used as supercapacitor electrodes with excellent specific capacitances, rate capabilities, and cycling stabilities. We finally discuss the current challenges and future opportunities in this research field. By regarding the graphene as both a single-atom-thick carbon sheet and a conjugated macromolecule, our work opens a new avenue to bottom-up self-assembly of graphene macromolecule sheets into functional 3D graphene macrostructures with remarkable electrochemical performances. We hope that this Account will promote further efforts toward fundamental investigation of graphene self-assembly and the development of advanced 3D graphene materials for their real-world applications in electrochemical energy storage devices and beyond.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Enhancing supercapacitive performance of polyaniline by interfacial copolymerization with melamine","Abstract":"Polyaniline is a promising pseudo-capacitive material due to its low cost, ease of synthesis and high theoretical capacitance.

Electrochemical characterizations of the products proved that copolymerization of polyaniline with melamine led to a considerable improvement in supercapacitive performance (specific capacitance of 720 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1) and 83 % capacitance retention after 1500 cycles) compared with pure PANI nanofibers obtained from the interfacial polymerization (specific capacitance value of 440 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1) and 30 % capacitance retention after 1250 cycles). Also, copolymer samples with higher melamine content showed better supercapacitive performance (AMC-1 vs. AMC-2).","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Electrospun nanofibers: A prospective electro-active material for constructing high performance Li-ion batteries","Abstract":"In the present review, we describe the development of a high energy density LIB fabricated with all 1D nanofibers as the anode and cathode, as well as a separator-cum-electrolyte prepared by an electrospinning technique without compromising the power capability and cycle life. Such a unique assembly certainly enables realizing the advantages of using 1D nanostructures in practical LIBs, irrespective of the anode or cathode in the presence of gelled polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene as the separator-cum-electrolyte. Outstanding cycling profiles with high power densities were noted for all the configurations evaluated.

Characterization by SEM, resistance to acid and alkali, TG, pH(pzc) and FT-IR was used to distinguish the superiority of the two adsorbents. The results showed that the linked-CMC-La had a higher decomposition temperature (200 degrees C) than CMC-La (190 degrees C) and a better resistance to acid and alkali compared with CMC-La. Batch adsorption experiments were also performed, varying factors of pH, initial fluoride concentration, and contact time. The results showed that the maximum removal efficiencies (REs) of CMC-La and linked-CMC-La were about 98.85% and 99.31%, respectively, when the fluoride concentration was 40 mg L-1 at pH 4.0. The adsorption process could be described well using the Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption kinetics data was fitted well using a pseudo-second-order model. The analysis of the adsorption and desorption of the linked-CMC-La and CMC-La revealed that crosslinking had no obvious effect on the removal efficiency or mechanism of the adsorption and desorption of the two absorbents. The surface adsorption occurred between the linked-CMC-La and fluoride due to Lewis acid-base interaction and supplemented with electrostatic attractions.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Exploration of the electrochemical mechanism of ultrasmall multiple phases molybdenum carbides nanocrystals for hydrogen evolution reaction","Abstract":"Sustainable and affordable hydrogen production through splitting of water, an essential step towards renewable and clean energy storage, calls for efficient non-precious-metal catalysts to make the process economically viable.

The aim of this study was to compare five methodologies for producing hybrid scaffolds for cell culture using poly-l-lactide (PLLA) and collagen: functionalization of PLLA electrospun by (1) dialkylamine and collagen immobilization with glutaraldehyde and by (2) hydrolysis and collagen immobilization with carbodiimide chemistry; (3) co-electrospinning of PLLA\/chloroform and collagen\/hexafluoropropanol (HFP) solutions; (4) co-electrospinning of PLLA\/chloroform and collagen\/acetic acid solutions and (5) electrospinning of a co-solution of PLLA and collagen using HFP. These materials were evaluated based on their morphology, mechanical properties, ability to induce cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity upon submission of mesenchymal stem cells to basal or osteoblastic differentiation medium (ODM). Methods (1) and (2) resulted in a decrease in mechanical properties, whereas methods (3), (4) and (5) resulted in materials of higher tensile strength and osteogenic differentiation. Materials yielded by methods (2), (3) and (5) promoted osteoinduction even in the absence of ODM.

We here analyze the coupling of flow and charge transport and charge capacitance in capacitive deionization (CDI). In CDI, a pair of porous carbon electrodes is employed to electrostatically retain and remove ionic species from aqueous solutions. We here develop and solve a novel unsteady two-dimensional model for capturing the ion adsorption\/desorption dynamics in a flow-between CDI system. We use this model to study the complex, nonlinear coupling between electromigration, diffusion, and advection of ions. We also fabricated a laboratory-scale CDI cell which we use to measure the near-equilibrium, cumulative adsorbed salt, and electric charge as a function of applied external voltage. We use these integral measures to validate and calibrate this model. We further present a detailed computational study of the spatiotemporal adsorption\/desorption dynamics under constant voltage and constant flow conditions. We show results for low (20 mM KCl) and relatively high (200 mM KCl) inlet ion concentrations and identify effects of ion starvation on desalination. We show that in both cases electromigrative transport eventually becomes negligible and diffusive ion transport reduces the desalination rate.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Bioinspired Polyaniline-Functional Natural Hairs for Pollen Protection","Abstract":"Self-assembled polyaniline nano-microspheres with a low cytotoxicity were synthesized by a simple temperature controlling method and uniformly distributed on animal hairs that had been chemically functionalized with 4-aminothiophenol.

The amount of the resin in the mixture was 0.5%, 1% and 1.5% of the total cement + EPS. The EPS ratios in the samples were determined as 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% of the total volume. The new samples were subjected to some tests to find out some thermal and mechanical properties. It was concluded that, when EPS ratios and resin ratios of the samples increased, the density, thermal conductivity, compressive strength and tensile strength decreased, and the porosity increased. The change in the physical properties shows that, some artificial pores (except from EPS's pores) are formed in concrete blocks which allow to increase the insulation characteristic of the material. As a result, it was recommended that; using EPS aggregated and resin-added concrete, (i) the waste EPS can be evaluated and environmental pollution can be prevented, (ii) the new produced samples can be used as partition walls, floorings, ceiling concretes, briquettes or bricks and plaster instead of building carrier systems such as columns or beams and by this the load of the building can be decreased.

In this work we investigate the role played by the organic coating in determining the pH-dependent PL. We compare two types of CdSe\/ZnS QDs equipped with different organic coatings, namely dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA)-capped QDs and phospholipid micelle-encapsulated QDs. Both QD types have their PL intensity quenched at acidic pH values, but they differ in terms of the reversibility of the quenching process. For DHLA-capped QDs, the quenching is nearly irreversible, with a small reversible component visible only on short time scales. For phospholipid micelle-encapsulated QDs the quenching is notably almost fully reversible. We suggest that the surface passivation by the organic ligands is reversible for the micelle-encapsulated QDs. Additionally, both coatings display pH-dependent spectral shifts. These shifts can be explained by a combination of irreversible processes, such as photo-oxidation and acid etching, and reversible charging of the QD surface, leading to the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE), the extent of each effect being coating-dependent. At high ionic strengths, the aggregation of QDs also leads to a spectral (red) shift, which is attributable to the QCSE and\/or electronic energy transfer.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"A low-cost and one-step synthesis of a novel hierarchically porous Fe3O4\/C composite with exceptional porosity and superior Li+ storage performance","Abstract":"A hierarchical pore structure is believed to be an excellent architecture for metal oxide anode materials of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the difficulty and complication in synthesis limit their further application. In this work, a novel Fe3O4\/C composite with a hierarchical pore carbon (HPC) network has been synthesized simply by one-step pyrolysis synthesis using ferrous gluconate as the precursor. This hierarchical porous framework derived from a loose assembly of the intersecting porous carbon rods presents a wide range of pore sizes and a rather large surface area (>226 cm(2) g(-1)). Embedded with well-crystalline Fe3O4 particles, the resulting Fe3O4@HPC composite exhibits a high capacity of 1112 mA h g(-1) at the end of the 100th cycle and an enhanced rate performance of above 600 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 2000 mA g(-1). This might derive from the unique hierarchical pore system with a high overall porosity, which can not only facilitate the electrolyte diffusion but also alleviate severe volume variation efficiently in lithium ion insertion\/extraction. More importantly, this provides us with a successful example to fabricate advanced anode materials simply by one-step pyrolysis of cheap organic-inorganic hybrids at low-cost.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Nitrofurazone-loaded electrospun PLLA\/sericin-based dual-layer fiber mats for wound dressing applications","Abstract":"The ideal wound dressing should achieve rapid healing with hemostasis, antimicrobial activity, maintenance of a moist wound bed, etc. The electrospun blend mat meets the requirements outlined for wound healing, by their microfibrous structures providing a suitable environment for wound healing. In this study, a dual-layer nanofiber blend mat wound dressing of nitrofurazone (NFZ)-loaded poly(L-lactide) (PLLA)\/sericin nanofibers and NFZ-loaded PLLA nanofibers is fabricated by electrospinning. The NFZ-loaded PLLA\/sericin nanofibers act as the first layer and then the NFZ-loaded PLLA nanofibers are the second layer to prepare the dual-layer fiber dressings. The prepared dual-layer NFZ-loaded fiber dressings have satisfactory antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In vitro drug release studies show that the drug release profiles can be controlled by adjusting the drug amount in different layers of the dual-layer dressings. The methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assays demonstrate that the NFZ-loaded PLLA\/sericin fibers are nontoxic and biocompatible. In vivo wound healing tests are performed in rats. The results reveal that the dual-layer fiber dressings perform better than commercial non-woven dressing in decreasing wound size. It is observed at 12 days that the wound size reduction is 97% for being dressed with the dual-layer fiber dressings but 84% for the commercial woven dressing. These NFZ-loaded PLLA\/sericinkPLLA dual-layer fiber mats may provide a promising candidate for accelerating wound healing.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Tracking of adipose tissue-derived progenitor cells using two magnetic nanoparticle types","Abstract":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is to be considered as an emerging detection technique for cell tracking experiments to evaluate the fate of transplanted progenitor cells and develop successful cell therapies for tissue engineering. Adipose tissue engineering using adipose tissue derived progenitor cells has been advocated for the cure of soft tissue defects or for persistent soft tissue augmentation. Adipose tissue derived progenitor cells were differentiated into the adipogenic lineage and labeled with two different types of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in varying concentrations which resulted in a concentration dependent reduction of gene expression of adipogenic differentiation markers, adiponectin and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), whereas the metabolic activity was not altered. As a result, only low nanoparticle concentrations for labeling were used for in vivo experiments. Cells were seeded onto collagen scaffolds and subcutaneously implanted into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. At 24 h as well as 28 clays after implantation, MRI analyses were performed visualizing nanoparticle-labeled cells using T2-weighted sequences.

In this technique a static and uniform electric field is applied to sliced tissue sections during matrix spray-coating, resulting in the enrichment of positively or negatively chargeable analytes in the MALDI matrix layer. Experimental results show that MCAEF not only increased the sensitivity of lipid and protein detection across the board in the subsequent MALDI-MS analyses, but also resulted in successful imaging of a larger number of analytes. MALDI imaging enhancement with MCAEF was observed for various tissues (rat liver, rat brain, and porcine adrenal gland) and with different MALDI matrices (e.g., quercetin, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, dithranol, 9-aminoacridine, and sinapinic acid) and the sensitivity increases were independent of the solvent compositions and pH values of the matrix solutions. Taking rat brain as an example, MCAEF led to the on-tissue detection and imaging of 648 identified lipids by combining positive and negative ion detection by MALDI-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS and with quercetin as the matrix, as compared to only 344 lipids without MCAEF. For protein imaging, up to 232 protein signals were successfully detected in rat brain tissue sections by MALDI-time-of-flight MS within a mass range of 3500 to 37 000 Da, as compared to 119 without MCAEF. MCAEF also enabled the detection of higher molecular-weight proteins. These results demonstrate the advantages of MCAEF for overall performance improvements in MALDI imaging and we believe that this technique has the potential to become a standard practice for MALDI tissue imaging.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Surface Modifications of Titanium Implants by Multilayer Bioactive Coatings with Drug Delivery Potential: Antimicrobial, Biological, and Drug Release Studies","Abstract":"Recent strategies to locally deliver antimicrobial agents to combat implant-associated infections-one of the most common complications in orthopedic surgery-are gaining interest.

This paper describes a selective aqueous conversion of fructose to HMF using carbon catalysts from pulping waste sodium ligninsulfonate (SLS). The effect of carbonization atmospheres (N-2 flow, static air and air flow) on the structure, porosity, compositions and acidic properties of carbon catalysts were investigated by thermogravimetry-mass spectrum analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Boehm titrations, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and elemental analysis. The carbonization in air flow favored the formation of more oxygen-containing functional groups and micropores, while more sulfonic groups and meso-\/macro-pores were formed during carbonization in a static air atmosphere. Both oxygen-and sulfur-containing groups were acid sites, and their total amount was the largest when carbonized in air flow, followed by static air and N-2 flow. The positive correlation between the acid amounts and fructose conversion of carbon catalysts clearly demonstrated the catalytic effect of the acid sites. The steric hindrance of micropores in carbon catalysts restricted the formation of humins and promoted the HMF selectivity compared with meso-\/macro-pores.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Triptolide Modulates TREM-1 Signal Pathway to Inhibit the Inflammatory Response in Rheumatoid Arthritis","Abstract":"Triptolide (TP), an active component isolated from Tripterygiumwilfordii Hook F, has therapeutic potential against rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the underlying molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of TP acting on RA by combining bioinformatics analysis with experiment validation. The human protein targets of TP and the human genes of RA were found in the PubChem database and NCBI, respectively. These two dataset were then imported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software online, and then the molecular network of TP on RA could be set up and analyzed. After that, both in vitro and in vivo experiments were done to further verify the prediction. The results indicated that the main canonical signal pathways of TP protein targets networks were mainly centered on cytokine and cellular immune signaling, and triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 signaling was searched to be the top one shared signaling pathway and involved in the cytokine and cellular immune signaling. Further in vitro experiments indicated that TP not only remarkably lowered the levels of TREM-1 and DNAX-associated protein (DAP) 12, but also significantly suppressed the activation of janus activating kinase (JAK) 2 and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 3. The expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6 in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated U937 cells also decreased after treatment with TP. Furthermore, TREM-1 knockdown was able to interfere with the inhibition effects of TP on these cytokines production. In vivo experiments showed that TP not only significantly inhibited the TREM-1 mRNA and DAP12 mRNA expression, and activation of JAK2 and STAT3 in ankle of rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), but also remarkably decreased production of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 in serum and joint.

It was found that the crosslinking ability of the oxide nanoparticles towards galactomannans is controlled by the electropositive character of M and the size of the nanoparticles which should be as small as possible (< 10 nm) to produce extremely viscous gels. The thermodynamic parameters Delta H, Delta S and Delta G for the association reaction obtained from ITC revealed that the interaction generally is entropy driven, slightly stronger for guar gum than for HPG and is decreasing from TiO2 to SnO2 to SiO2.

Similarly, a multi-walled carbon nanotubes-chitosan-gold nanoparticles-capturing antibody (MWCNTs-Ch-AuNPs-CAb) composite was used for comparison. Further, this bionanocomposite film modified GCE was subjected to SEB, which is detected in an electrochemical sandwich immunoassay format using ferrocene labeled-mice anti-SEB IgG (Fc-MAb) as the detection antibodies and we compared the sensitivity. The limit of detection is found to be 5 ng mL(-1) and 10 ng mL(-1) for GR-Ch-AuNPs and MWCNTs-Ch-Au NPs modified bionanocomposite films, respectively, and the total analysis time was 35 min. The signal amplification strategy proposed here is quite promising and can be extended for the monitoring of other biorecognition events. In addition, this is a reagentless and non-enzymatic method of electrochemical detection and is suitable for field use.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"PVP-derived carbon nanofibers harvesting enhanced anode performance for lithium ion batteries","Abstract":"Co-embedded carbon nanofibers were synthesized using electrospinning with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) instead of high cost polyacrylonitrile (PAN). The obtained composite nanofibers as an anode material for lithium ion batteries deliver a reversible capacity of 542.6 mA h g(-1) in the 100th cycle at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). Moreover, the anode material shows better cycle performance and rate capability in comparison to the resultant product without Co additive. It is believed that the significant improvement is attributed to the nanofiber morphology with high surface-to-volume ratio as well as the existence of Co nanoparticles that enhance the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Multivariate analysis of multi-sensor data for assessment of timber structures: Principles and applications","Abstract":"The proper timber structure assessment is of great importance to assure safe service of buildings as well as to preserve cultural heritage objects for future generations. However, due to peculiar anatomic structure of wood, anisotropy and heterogeneity, its characterization is a problematic task. Several methods are used nowadays for improving existing structure assessment routines, including also continuous monitoring of the structure performance. Current trend for using multiple sensors simultaneously is more favorable than a single sensor approach due to superior representation of the real-world cases. Moreover, the availability of novel statistical tools to handle many variables concurrently is another motivation for rapid changes within the field of measurement technology. It is important, therefore, to assure proper pre-processing of the signals from sensors, appropriate data fusion and optimal data analysis. The integrated use of non-destructive testing methodologies and data handling techniques to assess, monitor and predict properties of wood within structures and buildings is briefly described in this work. Examples for successful applications of the different data analysis techniques on the assessment and monitoring of civil engineering constitutions are reported. Multi-sensor approach may be a very attractive alternative to the conventional assessment and can provide supplementary data to be considered when inspector decision is made. It is assumed that, after additional developments, such methodologies can serve as assisting tools for non-destructive assessment of the wooden structures, service life prediction of structural elements and to support selection of optimal conservation process.

As a result, it is essential to gain a physical understanding of NP-membrane interactions to guide the design of next-generation bioactive nanoparticles. In previous work, we showed that charged, amphiphilic NPs can fuse with lipid bilayers after contact between protruding solvent-exposed lipid tails and the NP monolayer. Fusion was only observed at the high-curvature edges of large bilayer defects, but not in low-curvature regions where protrusions are rarely observed. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to show that the same NPs can also fuse with low-curvature bilayers in the absence of defects if NP-protrusion contact occurs, generalizing the results of our previous work. Insertion proceeds without applying biasing forces to the NP, driven by the hydrophobic effect, and involves the transient generation of bilayer curvature. We further find that NPs with long hydrophobic ligands can insert a single ligand into the bilayer core in a manner similar to the binding of peripheral proteins. Such anchoring may precede insertion, revealing potential methods for engineering NP monolayers to enhance NP-bilayer fusion in systems with a low likelihood of lipid tail protrusions. These results reveal new pathways for NP-bilayer fusion and provide fundamental insight into behavior at the nano-bio interface.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"BODIPY-Coumarin Conjugate as an Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Fluidity Sensor and Its Application to ER Stress Models","Abstract":"An endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-selective chemosensor composed of BODIPY and coumarin moieties and a long alkyl chain (n-C18) was synthesized.

The simulated data is found to exhibit good accordance with published experimental result. The study of the double staged membrane module with permeate recycle system, which was proposed to be the optimum configuration in previous works, has been extended by altering the recycle ratio of the permeate stream to study the process economics. Parameter sensitivities of typical membrane selectivity and CO2 feed concentration adapted in industrial application have been conducted. The study of high CO2 content is highlighted since it represents the future expansion of natural gas extraction considering that most of the remaining fields contain high concentration. It is observed that the recycle ratio is an important parameter to be considered in the industrial design process since it affects the gas processing cost significantly. Increasing the recycle ratio is proposed to increase the membrane area and compressor power while improving the hydrocarbon recovery, with substantial impact observed at low selectivity membrane and high CO2 feed concentration. A tradeoff must be determined among these parameters for determination of the optimal recycle ratio configuration. (C) 2014 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the metabolomic profiles of melioidosis patients are distinguishable from bacteremia patients and controls. Using multivariate and univariate analysis, 12 significant metabolites from four lipid classes, acylcarnitine (n = 6), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE) (n = 3), sphingomyelins (SM) (n = 2) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) (n = 1), with significantly higher levels in melioidosis patients than bacteremia patients and controls, were identified. Ten of the 12 metabolites showed area-under-receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) >0.80 when compared both between melioidosis and bacteremia patients, and between melioidosis patients and controls. SM(d18:2\/16:0) possessed the largest AUC when compared, both between melioidosis and bacteremia patients (AUC 0.998, sensitivity 100% and specificity 91.7%), and between melioidosis patients and controls (AUC 1.000, sensitivity 96.7% and specificity 100%). Our results indicate that metabolome profiling might serve as a promising approach for diagnosis of melioidosis using patient plasma, with SM(d18:2\/16:0) representing a potential biomarker. Since the 12 metabolites were related to various pathways for energy and lipid metabolism, further studies may reveal their possible role in the pathogenesis and host response in melioidosis.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Photoalignment of an Azobenzene-Based Chromonic Liquid Crystal Dispersed in Triacetyl Cellulose: Single-Layer Alignment Films with an Exceptionally High Order Parameter","Abstract":"Single-layer thin alignment films of dye molecules are of growing importance, particularly for state-of-the-art LCD technology.

Among all proposed anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, antimony is a desirable candidate due to its high theoretical capacity (660 mA h g(-1)). Herein, an antimony\/multilayer graphene hybrid, in which antimony is homogeneously anchored on multilayer graphene, is produced by a confined vapor deposition method. The chemical bonding can realize robust and intimate contact between antimony and multilayer graphene, and the uniform distribution of antimony and the highly conductive and flexible multilayer graphene can not only improve sodium ion diffusion and electronic transport but also stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase upon the large volume changes of antimony during cycling. Consequently, the antimony\/multilayer graphene hybrid shows a high reversible sodium storage capacity (452 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1)), stable long-term cycling performance with 90% capacity retention after 200 cycles, and excellent rate capability (210 mA h g(-1) under 5000 mA g(-1)).

In order to drive the water splitting reaction efficiently, substantial ohmic losses due to poor ionic conductivity of the electrolyte should be avoided, and therefore the reaction should be carried out at an extreme electrolyte pH. Herein we demonstrate the photoelectrochemical activity of an amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) photocathode for solar hydrogen evolution using an ultrathin nickel (Ni) film coupled with a nickel molybdenum catalyst (Ni-Mo) in a highly alkaline solution (pH 14). The incorporation of the Ni film coupled with Ni-Mo nanoparticles increases the number of active sites and therefore improves the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Additionally, we report the influence of the catalyst configurations on the ohmic and solid liquid junction behavior on semiconducting interfacial layers. The a-SiC photocathode coated with the Ni\/Ni-Mo dual-catalyst produces a photocurrent density of -14 mA cm(-2) at 0 V vs. RHE using only cheap and abundant materials.

Whereas many nanoscale electrodes are limited to low areal and\/or volumetric capacities, the particle\/polymer nanofiber anodes can be made thick with a high fiber volume fraction while maintaining good rate capabilities.

Similarly, thick nanofiber mats with a high areal capacity of 4.3mAhcm(-2) were prepared and characterized.

The porous TiO2 nanofiber templates effectively inhibit the aggregation growth of ZnS-In2S3 solid solution. The formation of ZnS-In2S3 solid solution is proved by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the intimate contact between TiO2 nanofibers and ZnS-In2S3 solid solution favors fast transfer of photogenerated electrons.

Capital cost and operating cost (excluding 33% feedstock cost) account for 34% and 33%, respectively, of the total biofuel production cost with enzyme cost alone representing about 47% of the operating cost.

Recent research has shown that hot acetic acid (AcOH)-water mixtures can be used to recover \"ultraclean\" lignins of controlled molecular weight from Kraft lignins. A key feature of this discovery is the existence of a region of liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE), with one phase being rich in the purified lignin and the other rich in solvent. Although visual methods can be used to determine the temperature at which solid lignin melts in the presence of AcOH-water mixtures to form LLE, the phase transition can be seen only at lower AcOH concentrations due to solvent opacity. Thus, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was developed for measuring the phase-transition temperature of a softwood Kraft lignin in AcOH-water mixtures. In electrochemical cells, the resistance to double-layer charging (i.e., polarization resistance R-p) is related to the concentration and mobility of free ions in the electrolyte, both of which are affected by the phases present. When the lignin-AcOH-water mixture was heated through the phase transition, R-P was found to be a strong function of temperature, with the maximum in R-P corresponding to the transition temperature obtained from visual observation. As the system is heated, acetate ions associate with the solid lignin, forming a liquefied, lignin-rich phase. This association increases the overall impedance of the system, as mobile acetate ions are stripped from the solvent phase and thus are no longer available to adsorb on the polarizing electrode surfaces. The maximum in RP occurs once the new lignin-rich phase has completely formed, and no further association of the lignin polymer with AcOH is possible. Except at sub-ambient temperatures, the phase-transition temperature was a strong function of solvent composition, increasing linearly from 18 degrees C at 70\/30 AcOH\/water to 97 degrees C at 10\/90 wt% AcOH\/water.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Tannins in Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy","Abstract":"This study provides an up to date review of tannins, specifically quebracho, in mineral processing and metallurgical processes.

The sacrificial PMMA template is removed during carbonization, creating a hollow core along with pores in the shell.

The photocatalytic transformation of lignin under mild conditions is particularly promising.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"A Novel Cathode Material for Cathodic Dehalogenation of 1,1-Dibromo Cyclopropane Derivatives","Abstract":"Leaded bronze turned out to be an excellent cathode material for the dehalogenation reaction of cyclopropanes without affecting the strained molecular entity. With this particular alloy, beneficial properties of lead cathodes are conserved, whereas the corrosion of cathode is efficiently suppressed. The solvent in the electrolyte determines whether a complete debromination reaction is achieved or if the process can be selectively stopped at the monobromo cyclopropane intermediate. The electro-organic conversion tolerates a variety of functional groups and can be conducted at rather complex substrates like cyclosporine A. This approach allows the sustainable preparation of cyclopropane derivatives.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Dramatically Promoted Swelling of a Hydrogel by Pillar[6]arene-Ferrocene Complexation with Multistimuli Responsiveness","Abstract":"The swelling shrinking transition of hydrogels is crucial for their wide applications such as actuators and drug delivery. We hereby fabricated a smart hydrogel with ferrocene groups on pendant of polymer networks. While it was immersed in the water-soluble pillar[6]arene (WP6) aqueous solution, the hydrogel was dramatically swollen, which was an approximately 11-fold promotion in weight compared with that in pure water, due to the formation of the inclusion complexes between WP6 and ferrocene groups in the hydrogel. In particular, the well-swollen hydrogel exhibited good responsiveness to multistimuli including temperature, pH, redox, and competitive guests by tuning the dissociation\/formation of WP6 ferrocene inclusion complexes or the strength of their charges. Meanwhile, potential application of such a smart hydrogel in pH-responsive drug release was demonstrated as well.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic polysaccharides in the presence of ionic liquids","Abstract":"Biofuels and -chemicals can be produced from carbohydrates in lignocellulosic biomass. For an efficient total enzymatic hydrolysis of the plant cell wall polysaccharides, a pretreatment step is required. Ionic liquids (ILs) have recently gained considerable interest as solvents for cellulose and lignocellulosic biomass and pretreatment of lignocellulose with ILs is currently an extensively studied concept. However, the applicability of ILs in an integrated process, in which enzymatic hydrolysis is done in the same vessel as the IL pretreatment without IL removal and substrate washing between the process steps, suffers from the fact that cellulose-dissolving ILs severely inactivate the cellulases used to catalyse the polysaccharide hydrolysis. This article reviews research on cellulase activity, stability and action in hydrolysis in cellulose-dissolving ILs, and different routes to increase the cellulase performance in these reaction systems. Impressive advances have recently been made in discovering and developing cellulases and other glycosyl hydrolases with increased IL-tolerance. Different cellulase stabilisation techniques and the design of enzyme-friendly cellulose-dissolving ILs are also discussed. In light of the recent developments, the integrated enzymatic hydrolysis of polysaccharides in the presence of ILs may well prove to be a potential route for utilizing lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock in biofuel and -chemical production.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Double-imprinted potentiometric sensors based on ligand exchange for the determination of dimethoate","Abstract":"This paper describes a dimethoate imprinted polymeric potentiometric sensor for the determination of dimethoate that was designed by dispersing the dimethoate-imprinted polymer in dibutyl phthalate plasticizer and then embedded in polyvinyl chloride matrix.

We have studied a method for the selective binding behavior of dimethoate compounds on the surface of imprinted polymers which is prepared using ligand-exchange (LE) (chitosan-Cd(II)) monomer.

In this regard, our research group has recently demonstrated the in vivo effectiveness of the topical administration of rhEGF-loaded lipid nanoparticles in healing-impaired db\/db mice. Herewe report the effectiveness of rhEGF-NLC (rhEGF loaded nanostructured lipid carriers) in a more relevant preclinical model of wound healing, the porcine full-thickness excisional wound model. The rhEGF-NLC showed a particle size of around 335 nm, negative surface charge (-27 mV) and a high encapsulation efficiency of 94%. rhEGF plasma levels were almost undetectable, suggesting that no systemic absorption occurred, which may minimise potential side effects and improve treatment safety. In vivo healing experiments carried out in large white pigs demonstrated that 20 mu g of rhEGF-NLC topically administered twice a week increased the wound closure and percentage of healed wounds by day 25, compared with the same number of intralesional administrations of 75 mu g free rhEGF and empty NLC. Moreover, rhEGF-NLC improved the wound healing quality expressed in terms of number of arranged microvasculature, fibroblast migration and proliferation, collagen deposition and evolution of the inflammatory response. Overall, these findings demonstrated that topically administered rhEGF-NLC may generate de novo intact skin after full thickness injury in a porcine model, thereby confirming their potential clinical application for the treatment of chronic wounds.

The calculated bond dissociation enthalpy, ionization potential, and proton dissociation enthalpy revealed that the H-atoms at positions 2-isopropyl and 5-methyl groups can be readily abstracted. In fact, the 2-isopropyl C-H bond dissociation enthalpy is lower than the 5-methyl C-H dissociation enthalpy. Analysis of spin density distribution indicates that H-atom abstraction in 2-isopropyl site generates more stable radical. The plots of highest occupied molecular orbital of thymoquinone demonstrate that the whole molecule can be easily attacked by electrophilic agents like radicals. In this paper, we studied the interaction of thymoquinone with hydroxyl, hydroperoxyl, and superoxide anion radicals, using potential energy surface scans and natural bond orbital analysis. Calculated potential energy barriers for hydroxyl radical attack (similar to 2.5 kJ\/mol) revealed an instant scavenging by thymoquinone. Modeling of the reaction between thymoquinone and lipid peroxyl radical shows a barrier energy around 26.23 kJ\/mol. .","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Semitransparent polymer-based solar cells via simple wet lamination process with TiO2 layer using automatic spray layer-by-layer method","Abstract":"Semitransparent polymer-based solar cells are renewable, lightweight and low-cost energy sources and are attracting increasing attention in terms of both pure scientific research and commercial applications. The carrier transport layer in most polymer solar cells is composed of a TiO2 layer, and the thickness and homogeneity of this layer strongly influence the cell's power conversion efficiency. However, despite considerable development efforts, it is difficult to produce precisely-controlled TiO2 layers at room temperature with low fabrication times and without using materials that are toxic to humans. Here, we demonstrate semitransparent polymer-based solar cells fabricated via a simple wet lamination process with a TiO2 layer produced by an automatic spray layer-by-layer (spray-LBL) self-assembly method for improved solar cells. The spray-LBL method produced nano-ordered precursor films, composed of the non-toxic materials poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and titanium(IV) bis(ammonium lactato) dihydroxide (TALH), from water solutions with high uniformity in a short fabrication time, and these films were then annealed to transform them into TiO2 layers at different temperatures. After TiO2 layer preparation, the polymer solar cells were fabricated via a lamination process. The resulting cells were semitransparent and generated electricity by using the incident light from both the front and back sides. These semitransparent polymer-based solar cells produced power conversion efficiencies of more than 2% by varying the TiO2 layer thickness via control of the spray-LBL process and the annealing temperature.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Electrode Engineering of Conversion-based Negative Electrodes for Na-ion Batteries","Abstract":"Due to lower costs and higher abundance of sodium, Na-ion battery technology can offer a good alternative to Li-ion batteries. Much research is focusing on developing new cathode and anode materials but the importance of the electrode engineering on the electrochemical performance is often neglected. The electrode composition is especially crucial for conversion reaction-based materials where the composite electrode (active material, conducting additive and binder) has to buffer the huge volume change occurring upon cycling. This work highlights the differences observed on Sn-CMC electrode performance by using different Sn particle sizes (micro- and nanoparticles) and evaluating the role of the conductive additive in the electrode. Carbon fibers (VGCF) demonstrate a good ability to surround micrometer particles but not especially nanometer particles leading to an improvement in the performance of microparticles but not of nanoparticles. For a high loading electrode suitable for full cell applications (>3.5 mg\/cm(2) of active material), nanometer particles show limited performance for long-term cycling. The combination of VGCF with micrometer particles seems to be the most promising composition to obtain good performances for conversion reaction based-materials.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Carbonaceous materials as substitutes for conventional dye-sensitized solar cell counter electrodes","Abstract":"Due to the rapid growth in energy demand, renewable energy plays a great role in both economics and energy supply.

Dye-sensitized solar cells, as the third generation of solar cells, have been attracting increasing attention. The development of counter electrodes, as one of the key components in electron cycling and redox reaction (to regenerate oxidized electrolyte), has faced several challenges due to their high price and the complicated deposition process of conventional platinum electrode. As cost effective materials, scientists have proposed carbonaceous materials as Pt alternatives that satisfy the catalytic role. In this paper, carbonaceous materials as counter electrodes are reviewed. Carbon structures present a high surface area as well as low impedance which lead to efficient solar cells. Improvements occur through modulating the porosity or nanostructure which is determined by the material morphologies; in this regard, some disadvantages associated with the fabrication procedure, also are included in the discussion.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Preparation and characterization of a chitosan-based low-pH-sensitive intelligent corrosion inhibitor","Abstract":"A chitosan (CS)-based low-pH-sensitive intelligent corrosion inhibitor was prepared by loading a pH-sensitive hydrogel with benzotriazole (BTA); the pH-sensitive hydrogel was synthetized by crosslinking CS with glutaraldehyde (GTA). Analysis by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy showed that Schiff reactions occurred between amino and aldehyde groups. The swelling ability of the hydrogel was investigated using a mass method, and it was observed to swell more in an acidic environment than in an alkaline environment. The hydrogel's loading capacity of BTA was approximately 0.377 g.g(-1), and its release speed was faster in an acidic environment than in an alkaline environment because of its swelling behavior. The corrosion inhibition ability of the intelligent inhibitor was tested by immersion and electrochemical methods. The results showed that after 4 h of immersion, the polarization resistance (R-p) value of copper with the intelligent inhibitor was approximately twice of that of copper with BTA, indicating that the intelligent inhibitor could effectively prevent copper from corroding.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Trans-cis isomerization assisted synthesis of solution-processable yellow fluorescent maleic anhydrides for white-light generation","Abstract":"Heterocyclic maleic anhydride derivatives have been extensively studied in natural products chemistry over the past few decades.

The development of emissive pi-conjugated materials for (WLEDs) has been an emerging scientific and technological research area to replace phosphors used in LED-based solid-state lighting. Here, we demonstrate the design, synthesis and characterization of two new highly emissive alkyl-substituted bis(thienyl)maleic anhydrides (C6-Th2MA and C12-Th2MA) with favorable photophysical properties. The new core is synthesized via a novel trans-to-cis isomerization-assisted one-pot reaction, which is demonstrated for the first time in the literature for the synthesis of a bis(heteroaryl)maleic anhydride. Due to its favorable absorption and fluorescence properties in the blue and yellow region of the visible spectrum, respectively, C12-Th2MA is studied as a potential wavelength-upconverting material. A WLED fabricated by drop-casting a polymeric solution of C12-Th2MA on a blue LED (InGaN, 455 nm) yields promising CIE coordinates and color-rendering index (CRI) values of (0.24, 0.20) and 65.0, respectively. Considering the simplicity of the current molecular structure and facile synthesis, alkyl-substituted bis(thienyl)maleic anhydrides stand as ideal phosphor alternatives.

In this study, carbon coated hollow structured NVP\/C composites are synthesized via a template-free and scalable ultrasonic spray pyrolysis process, where the carbon coated NVP particles are uniformly decorated on the inner and outer surfaces of the porous hollow carbon spheres. When evaluated as a cathode material for SIBs, the unique NVP\/C porous hollow sphere cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 99.2 mA h g(-1) and retains 89.3 mA h g(-1) after 300 charge\/discharge cycles with a very low degradation rate of 0.035% per cycle.

Metal oxide nanosheets were observed to grow vertically from the surface of CNFs. The high structural toughness of the CNF-metal oxide composite under strong sonication indicated strong interfacial binding strength between the metal oxide and the CNFs. The rationally designed porous CNFs presented a high specific surface area and showed high capacity for adsorbing metal ions, where the active edge sites acted as anchoring sites for the nucleation of metal oxides, thereby leading to the formation of a well dispersed and thin layer structure of binary metal oxide nanosheets. Excellent electrochemical performance (e.g., specific capacitance of 2894.70 F g(-1) and energy density of 403.28 W h kg(-1)) was observed for these binary metal oxide nanosheets, which can be attributed to the large increase in the accessible surface area of the electrochemically active metal oxide nanosheets due to their homogeneous distribution on porous CNFs, as well as the efficient charge transfer from the metal oxide to the CNFs facilitated the improvement in the performance.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"A molecular view of the role of chirality in charge-driven polypeptide complexation","Abstract":"Polyelectrolyte molecules of opposite charge are known to form stable complexes in solution. Depending on the system conditions, such complexes can be solid or liquid. The latter are known as complex coacervates, and they appear as a second liquid phase in equilibrium with a polymer-dilute aqueous phase. This work considers the complexation between poly(glutamic acid) and poly(lysine), which is of particular interest because it enables examination of the role of chirality in ionic complexation, without changes to the overall chemical composition. Systematic atomic-level simulations are carried out for chains of poly(glutamic acid) and poly(lysine) with varying combinations of chirality along the backbone. Achiral chains form unstructured complexes. In contrast, homochiral chains lead to formation of stable beta-sheets between molecules of opposite charge, and experiments indicate that beta-sheet formation is correlated with the formation of solid precipitates. Changes in chirality along the peptide backbone are found to cause \"kinks\" in the beta-sheets. These are energetically unfavorable and result in irregular structures that are more difficult to pack together. Taken together, these results provide new insights that may be of use for the development of simple yet strong bioinspired materials consisting of beta-rich domains and amorphous regions.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Manipulating the interfacial interactions of composite membranes via a mussel-inspired approach for enhanced separation selectivity","Abstract":"For the broadly utilized composite membranes with dense separation layers and porous support layers, the rational manipulation of interfacial interactions between these two layers is vital in optimizing the membrane structure and the associated performance. In this study, we report a facile mussel-inspired approach to enhance the separation selectivity of composite membranes by co-depositing biomimetic adhesive dopamine and poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) on a support layer and then coating with sodium alginate (SA) as the separation layer. PEI is anchored onto the support layer surface through the reaction with dopamine during the polydopamine (PDA) formation process, thus incorporating the electrostatic attraction interaction into the interface in addition to the hydrogen bond interaction between PDA and SA. Using water\/alcohol separation as the model system, the separation factor of the SA\/PEI-PDA\/PAN membrane can reach 1807, which is 29.6 and 6.8 times higher than those of SA\/PAN and SA\/PDA\/PAN membranes, respectively. The remarkably enhanced separation factor arises from the optimal free volume property and swelling resistance of the membrane under the optimized interfacial interactions between the separation layer and support layer. This study may present an efficient and facile approach for tailoring the membrane structure for an enhanced separation performance.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Tumor with a Self-Traceable Phosphorylcholine Polymer","Abstract":"Polymers are concentration-amplified with respect to the monomeric units.

Preliminary measurements indicated that the present polymeric nanoprobe was satisfactorily distinguished from lipids and detectable with far sub-micromolar spectroscopic and far sub-millimolar imaging sensitivities. Detailed ex vivo and in vivo studies for the tumor-bearing mice administered the probe with a mean molecular weight of 63 000 and a mean size of 13 nm, revealed the following: (1) this probe accumulates in the tumor highly selectively (besides renal excretion) and efficiently (up to 30% of the injected dose), (2) the tumor can thus be clearly in vivo imaged, the lowest clearly imageable dose of the probe being 100 mg\/kg or 2.0 mg\/20-g mouse, and (3) the competition between renal excretion and tumor accumulation is size-controlled; that is, the larger (higher molecular-weight) and smaller (lower molecular-weight) portions of the probe undergo tumor accumulation and renal excretion, respectively. The observed size dependence suggests that the efficient tumor-targeting of the present probe is stimulated primarily by the so-called enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, that is, size-allowed invasion of the probe into the tumor tissue via defective vascular wall. Self-traceable polymers thus open an important area of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of tumors and may provide a highly potential tool to visualize various delivery\/localization processes using synthetic polymers.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"pi-Electron Systems That Form Planar and Interlocked Anion Complexes and Their Ion-Pairing Assemblies","Abstract":"Interactions between designed charged species are important for the ordered arrangements of pi-electron systems in assembled structures.

In order to conduct ANN modeling, the considered parameters and experimental outputs were categorized into (i) training, (ii) validating and (iii) testing datasets, which were subsequently analyzed using three different training algorithms, including scaled conjugate gradient, Bayesian regularization, and Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation. The comparison study between three artificial neural network models indicates that all back-propagation methods could be employed to estimate the cathodic current accurately. The results of cyclic voltammetry demonstrated that the cathodic current increased as a function of decreasing simulated body fluid concentration, immersion time and carbon nanofiber diameter. The Pearson correlation coefficients were significant at less than the 0.01% level for all prediction models. Among the studied algorithms, the scaled conjugate gradient back-propagation method produced the highest R-value at 0.92.

Nanogenerators (NGs) based on piezoelectric nanowires are particularly attractive due to their sensitivity to small-scale vibrations and may possess superior mechanical-to-electrical conversion efficiency when compared to bulk or thin-film devices of the same material. However, candidate piezoelectric nanowires have hitherto been predominantly analyzed in terms of NG output (i.e. output voltage, output current and output power density). Surprisingly, the corresponding dynamical properties of the NG, including details of how the nanowires are mechanically driven and its impact on performance, have been largely neglected. Here we investigate all realizable NG driving contexts separately involving inertial displacement, applied stress T and applied strain S, highlighting the effect of driving mechanism and frequency on NG performance in each case. We argue that, in the majority of cases, the intrinsic high resonance frequencies of piezoelectric nanowires (similar to tens of MHz) present no barrier to high levels of NG performance even at frequencies far below resonance (< 1 kHz) typically characteristic of ambient vibrations. In this context, we introduce vibrational energy harvesting (VEH) coefficients eta S and eta T, based on intrinsic materials properties, for comparing piezoelectric NG performance under strain-driven and stress-driven conditions respectively. These figures of merit permit, for the first time, a general comparison of piezoelectric nanowires for NG applications that takes into account the nature of the mechanical excitation. We thus investigate the energy harvesting performance of prototypical piezoelectric ceramic and polymer nanowires. We find that even though ceramic and polymer nanowires have been found, in certain cases, to have similar energy conversion efficiencies, ceramics are more promising in strain-driven NGs while polymers are more promising for stress-driven NGs.

The nanofibers thus obtained, found to preserve their parent fluorescence nature, confirmed the avoidance of aggregation during fiber formation. The trace detection of trinitrotoluene (TNT) in water with a detection limit of 5 nM was demonstrated, which is much lower than the maximum allowable limit set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Interestingly, the sensing performance was found to be selective toward TNT in water, even in the presence of higher concentrations of toxic metal pollutants such as Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+.

In this study, the effect of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) on the microstructure formation as well as on the rheological properties in the aqueous anode slurries is investigated. The graphite particles aggregate with each other due to their hydrophobicity and form a gel structure in an aqueous slurry. Both CMC and SBR induce the dispersion of the graphite particles by adsorbing onto the graphite surface. In the graphite\/CMC\/SBR slurry, the SBR can affect the dispersion of the graphite particles at low CMC concentration, while the microstructure is not changed regardless of added SBR at high CMC concentration because the SBR cannot adsorb on the graphite surface due to the presence of CMC.

A solution of P3HT in 1,2,4-trichlorbenzene (TCB) was added to an aqueous dispersion of the hydrophobin, Cerato ulmin (CU). Upon gentle agitation, the semiconductor solution was readily confined within CU membrane-stabilized microstructures, often with extended shapes. UV-vis and polarized micro-Raman spectroscopy suggested complex, enhanced molecular alignment due to a transition from isotropic to liquid crystalline fluid to polycrystalline states. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction corroborates this interpretation. On aging, the initial CU:P3HT\/TCB structures develop dendritic architectures that slowly release polymer-containing capsules. The counterintuitive evolution from large structures to smaller ones suggests the initial structures were nonequilibrium, and it opens the door to latex-like processing of semiconducting polymers into crystalline, high-performance thin films for device applications. Preliminary studies using an organic field-effect transistor architecture suggest that optimized processing and device configuration will enable highly crystalline active materials with efficient charge transport characteristics.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Optical sensor: a promising strategy for environmental and biomedical monitoring of ionic species","Abstract":"Considerable amount of research has been carried out on designing and improving metal-recognition methodologies in environmental and biological media. The development of fluorescent-based techniques has proven to be an important milestone for non-invasive metal detection and quantification in a multichannel environment. Metals as natural components of the Earth's crust are generally present in trace concentrations in environmental samples, wherein humic substances have a complexation affinity toward them. Iron, zinc and copper are the 1st, 2nd and 3rd most abundant elements that are indispensable to the human body in trace amounts as they play crucial roles in many biological processes. However, unregulated amounts either an excess or deficiency may exacerbate deterioration of the vital organs and trigger the progression of complications. In addition to these three essential elements, mercury is widely considered to be one of the most hazardous pollutants and highly dangerous elements due to its recognized accumulative and toxic effects in the environment and in biological media. In the present study, we attempted to summarize all the recently developed fluorescent signaling materials for the detection of Cu2+, Fe2+\/Fe3+, Zn2+ and Hg2+. The spectral shifts in the molecules on metal chelation, the mode of complexation and the stoichiometries of the resulting adducts have been discussed in detail. Furthermore, we highlight molecules that have been reported as an intracellular metal detector via bioimaging, which can be useful for the future design and development of cell-viable and membrane-permeable molecular probes.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Nanoscratch technique for aligning multiwalled carbon nanotubes synthesized by the arc discharge method in open air","Abstract":"Horizontally aligned and densely packed multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were synthesized in an open air, without the need for a controlled atmosphere, using a rotating cathode arc discharge method with the help of a metal scraper. The physical force exerted by the scraper results in in-situ alignment of MWCNTs along the direction of scrape marks. This strategy, which enables the alignment of nanotubes in a controlled fashion to any length and direction of interest, was examined to determine the force required to align a nanotube. A model is developed to understand the alignment process. Using the nanoscratch technique to mimic this strategy, and incorporating the data obtained from the nanoscratch technique into the model developed, the minimum force required to align a MWCNT, as well as the energy required to align a gram of nanotubes, has been estimated. The method demonstrated represents an economical approach for large-scale synthesis of aligned MWCNTs at low costs.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Efficient Electrochemical and Photoelectrochemical H-2 Production from Water by a Cobalt Dithiolene One-Dimensional Metal-Organic Surface","Abstract":"Solar-driven hydrogen evolution from water has emerged as an important methodology for the storage of renewable energy in chemical bonds. Efficient and practical clean-energy devices for electrochemical or photoelectrochemical splitting of water require the immobilization of stable and active hydrogen-evolving catalysts onto electrode or photocathode materials, which remains a significant challenge. Here we show that cobalt(II) reacts with benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrathiol in the presence of base to form a cobalt dithiolene polymer 1. The generated polymer is immobilized onto glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) to generate a metal organic surface (MOS 1IGCE), which displays efficient H-2-evolving activity and stability in acidic aqueous solutions. Moreover, the generated polymer is integrated with planar p-type Si to generate very efficient photocathode materials (MOS 1ISi) for solar-driven hydrogen production from water. Photocurrents up to 3.8 mA\/cm(2) at 0 V vs RHE were achieved under simulated 1 Sun illumination. MOS 1ISi photocathodes operate at potentials 550 mV more positive than MOS 1IGCE cathodes to reach the same activity for H-2 evolution from water (1 mA\/cm(2)).","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Overcoming inactivation of the lung surfactant by serum proteins: a potential role for fluorocarbons?","Abstract":"In many pulmonary conditions serum proteins interfere with the normal adsorption of components of the lung surfactant to the surface of the alveoli, resulting in lung surfactant inactivation, with potentially serious untoward consequences. Here, we review the strategies that have recently been designed in order to counteract the biophysical mechanisms of inactivation of the surfactant. One approach includes protein analogues or peptides that mimic the native proteins responsible for innate resistance to inactivation. Another perspective uses water-soluble additives, such as electrolytes and hydrophilic polymers that are prone to enhance adsorption of phospholipids. An alternative, more recent approach consists of using fluorocarbons, that is, highly hydrophobic inert compounds that were investigated for partial liquid ventilation, that modify interfacial properties and can act as carriers of exogenous lung surfactant. The latter approach that allows fluidisation of phospholipid monolayers while maintaining capacity to reach near-zero surface tension definitely warrants further investigation.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Biomimetic Taste Receptors with Chiral Recognition by Photoluminescent Metal-Organic Frameworks Chelated with Polyaniline Helices","Abstract":"The adsorption of phenylaniline (Phe) enantiomers on (+)-polyaniline (PAN)-chelated [In(OH)(bdc)](n) microcrystals was carefully designed and studied by using the Job titration, circular dichroism, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and photoluminescence to mimic heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors in selective, but not specific, ligand binding with chiral recognition and signal transduction.

A lipid membrane-compatible selenenylsulfide derivative, 1-oxoheadecyl-seleno-L-cysteine-methyl-Se-yl-S-L-penicillamine methyl ester (OHSeP), was synthesized. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the sulfur and selenium atoms of the OHSeP molecule formed a selenenylsulfide linkage. The use of OHSeP easily allowed the introduction of the seleno-L-cysteine (SeCys) moiety into the liposomal membranes by mixing with the phosphatidylcholines (PCs), which gave rise to the GPx-like catalytic activity because of the selenium atom in the SeCys moiety. The penicillamine moiety of the OHSeP molecule incorporated into the OHSeP\/PC liposomes was thought to orient toward the outer water phase. The OHSeP\/PC liposomes generated the GPx-like catalytic activity, which was ascribed to the SeCys moiety that was introduced into the PC-based liposomes. Consequently, the lipid\/water interface of the liposomal membranes could possibly provide an effective colloidal platform for the development of water-soluble nanosized GPx mimics.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Solar-Driven Reduction of Aqueous Protons Coupled to Selective Alcohol Oxidation with a Carbon Nitride-Molecular Ni Catalyst System","Abstract":"Solar water-splitting represents an important strategy toward production of the storable and renewable fuel hydrogen. The water oxidation half-reaction typically proceeds with poor efficiency and produces the unprofitable and often damaging product, O-2. Herein, we demonstrate an alternative approach and couple solar H-2 generation with value-added organic substrate oxidation. Solar irradiation of a cyanamide surface-functionalized melon-type carbon nitride ((CNx)-C-NCN) and a molecular nickel(II) bis(diphosphine) H-2-evolution catalyst (NiP) enabled the production of H-2 with concomitant selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols to aldehydes in high yield under purely aqueous conditions, at room temperature and ambient pressure. This one-pot system maintained its activity over 24 h, generating products in 1:1 stoichiometry, separated in the gas and solution phases. The (CNx)-C-NCN-NiP system showed an activity of 763 mu mol (g CNx)(-1) h(-1) toward H-2 and aldehyde production, a Ni-based turnover frequency of 76 h(-1), and an external quantum efficiency of 15% (lambda = 360 +\/- 10 nm). This precious metal-free and nontoxic photocatalytic system displays better performance than an analogous system containing platinum instead of NiP. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the photoactivity of (CNx)-C-NCN is due to efficient substrate oxidation of the material, which outweighs possible charge recombination compared to the nonfunctionalized melon type carbon nitride. Photoexcited (CNx)-C-NCN in the presence of an organic substrate can accumulate ultralong-lived \"trapped electrons\", which allow for fuel generation in the dark. The artificial photosynthetic system thereby catalyzes a closed redox cycle showing 100% atom economy and generates two value-added products, a solar chemical, and solar fuel.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Adsorptive removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions by cross-linked chitosan\/bentonite composite","Abstract":"Cross-linked chitosan\/bentonite composite (CCB) was prepared, and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, BET surface area and pore diameter analyses, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA).

The removal towards Cr(VI) decreased with increasing solution pH from 2 to 11 and initial Cr(VI) concentration, while it increased with increasing adsorbent dosage. The adsorption kinetic data of Cr(VI) on CCB were well described by the pseudo-second-order model. The equilibrium data were correlated by the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum monolayer Cr(VI) adsorption capacity for CCB at pH 2 and 293 K was 89.13mg\/g.

It was revealed that the as-synthesized heterostructured PbTiO3\/CdS nanorods exhibited higher photocatalytic performance in the degradation of MB under visible light irradiation than pristine PbTiO3 nanorods and CdS nanoparticles. The enhanced performance is associated with a suitable band alignment and the promoted separation of photogenerated carriers by forming sharp interfaces between PbTiO3 and CdS in the heterostructure.

Thiophene plasma polymerization was used to deposit sulfur-rich films onto silica particles followed by the introduction of oxidized sulfur functionalities, such as sulfonate and sulfonic acid, via water-plasma treatments. Surface chemistry analyses were conducted by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy. Electrokinetic measurements quantified the zeta potentials and isoelectric points (IEPs) of modified particles and indicated significant decreases of zeta potentials and IEPs upon plasma modification of particles. Plasma polymerized thiophene-coated particles treated with water plasma for 10 min exhibited an IEP of less than 3.5. The effectiveness of developed surfaces in the adsorption of heavy metal ions was demonstrated through copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) removal experiments. The removal of metal ions was examined through changing initial pH of solution, removal time, and mass of particles. Increasing the water plasma treatment time to 20 min significantly increased the metal removal efficiency (MRE) of modified particles, whereas further increasing the plasma treatment time reduced the MRE due to the influence of an ablation mechanism. The developed particulate surfaces were capable of removing more than 96.7% of both Cu and Zn ions in 1 h. The combination of plasma polymerization and oxidative plasma treatment is an effective method for the fabrication of new adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Ultrafast thermal charging of inorganic nano-phase change material composites for solar thermal energy storage","Abstract":"The present research article reports the heat transfer characteristics of nano-phase change material (NPCM) composites: nanographite (NG)-PCM composites and multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT)-PCM composites. For the preparation of NPCM composites, inorganic PCM, magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O) was used as the pristine PCM and nanocellulose was used as a stabilizing agent. NG-PCM composites were prepared by varying the concentration of NG from 0.1-0.6 wt%, whereas CNT-PCM composites were prepared using 0.1 and 0.2 wt% of CNT. The prepared NPCM composites exhibited enhanced thermal conductivity and a faster heating rate than pristine PCMs. Two different experimental setups were used for investigating the heat transfer characteristics of the prepared NPCM composites during the melting and solidification processes: (i) conventional heating and (ii) solar illumination. The experimental observations indicated a higher heat transfer rate in the NPCM composites as compared to pristine PCM for both experimental setups. It was observed that the heating melting and solidification rate using a conventional heating setup increased by 48% and 77%, respectively, for NG-PCM composites (at 0.6 wt%) & 24% and 15%, respectively for CNT-PCM composites (at 0.2 wt%). Upon solar illumination, both NG-PCM and CNT-PCM composites demonstrated an ultrafast heating rate (of the order of few seconds) and a higher heating temperature than the conventional heating based approach. The ultrafast heating of NPCM composites upon solar illumination was attributed to the plasmonic heating effect of carbon nanomaterials, which instantly convert optical energy into heat at nanometer scale in addition to conventional thermal diffusion based slow heating, the sole mechanism responsible for slow heating of PCM composites in a conventional heating setup. Out of the two carbon nanofillers used, CNTs were shown to have a better heat transfer performance than NGs to collect, convert and store the broad spectrum solar energy as thermal energy.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Incorporation of a Non-Natural Arginine Analogue into a Cyclic Peptide Leads to Formation of Positively Charged Nanofibers Capable of Gene Transfection","Abstract":"Functionalization of the tetracationic cyclic peptide (Ka)(4) with a single guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole (GCP) moiety, a weakly basic but highly efficient arginine analogue, completely alters the self-assembly properties of the peptide.

The model is formulated in an infinitesimal strain framework, where the total strain is decomposed into elastic and plastic parts. The model adopts a standard linear viscoelastic solid model expressed in terms of Boltzmann hereditary integral form, which is coupled to a rate-dependent viscoplastic formulation to describe the irreversible plastic part of the overall strain. An anisotropic hardening law with a kinematic effect is particularly adopted in order to capture the complex stress-strain hysteresis typically observed in polymeric materials. In addition, the present model accounts for the effects of material densification associated with through-thickness compression, which are captured using an exponential law typically applied in the continuum description of elasticity in porous media. Material parameters used in the present model are calibrated to the experimental data for high-density (press)boards. The experimental characterization procedures as well as the calibration of the parameters are highlighted. The results of the model simulations are systematically analyzed and validated against the corresponding experimental data. The comparisons show that the predictions of the present model are in very good agreement with the experimental observations for both stationary and transient load cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As it is widely used in industry and leather tanning, it may accumulate locally at high concentrations, raising concerns for human health hazards. Though Cr effects have extensively been investigated in animals and mammals, in plants they are poorly understood. The present study was then undertaken to determine the ultrastructural malformations induced by hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], the most toxic form provided as 100 M potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), in the root tip cells of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A concentration-dependent decrease of root growth and a time-dependent increase of dead cells, callose deposition, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and peroxidase activity were found in Cr(VI)-treated seedlings, mostly at the transition root zone. In the same zone, nuclei remained ultrastructurally unaffected, but in the meristematic zone some nuclei displayed bulbous outgrowths or contained tubular structures. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was less affected under Cr(VI) stress, but Golgi bodies appeared severely disintegrated. Moreover, mitochondria and plastids became spherical and displayed translucent stroma with diminished internal membranes, but noteworthy is that their double-membrane envelopes remained structurally intact. Starch grains and electron dense deposits occurred in the plastids. Amorphous material was also deposited in the cell walls, the middle lamella and the vacuoles. Some vacuoles were collapsed, but the tonoplast appeared integral. The plasma membrane was structurally unaffected and the cytoplasm contained opaque lipid droplets and dense electron deposits. All electron dense deposits presumably consisted of Cr that is sequestered from sensitive sites, thus contributing to metal tolerance. It is concluded that the ultrastructural changes are reactive oxygen species (ROS)-correlated and the malformations observed are organelle specific.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"SOME APPROACHES TO VISCOMETRIC STUDY OF CHITOSAN IN ACETIC ACID SOLUTION","Abstract":"Some ways of estimating the values of the intrinsic viscosity of chitosan were analyzed.

Recently, we found that faint electric treatment (fET) of cells enhanced delivery of siRNA and functional nucleic acids into the cytoplasm in the absence of delivery carriers. Here, we examined fET of cells stably expressing luciferase in the presence of iRed encoding anti-luciferase shRNA. Transfection of lipofectamine 2000 (LFN)\/iRed lipoplexes showed an RNAi effect, but fET-mediated iRed transfection did not, likely because of the endosomal localization of iRed after delivery. However, fET in the presence of lysosomotropic agent chloroquine significantly improved the RNAi effect of iRed\/fET to levels that were higher than those for the LFN\/iRed lipoplexes. Furthermore, the amount of lipid droplets in adipocytes significantly decreased following fET with iRed against resistin in the presence of chloroquine.

However, these aggregates are still underutilized in cement-treated materials (CTMs), which consist of mixtures of aggregates blended with small amounts of cement and water that harden after compaction to form a strong paving material. In the light of these considerations, different cement-treated materials, each containing different percentages of natural and artificial aggregates were analyzed. After a preliminary characterization of chemical, physical and durability properties of EAF slag aggregates, a mix design procedure based on both moisture-density approach (gyratory compactor) and mechanical testing (unconfined compression test and indirect tensile test) was performed to identify the optimum cement and water content of CTMs. The design mixtures were then subjected to 5 different accelerated aging procedures in order to study the influence of some factors (temperature, pressure and humidity) on the durability of the cement-treated materials. The results highlighted how the EAF slags represent suitable aggregates for cement-treated materials. The use of these aggregates produced a greater compaction difficulty, but guaranteed excellent mechanical performances, above all in terms of indirect tensile strength. The durability analysis demonstrated that the recycled mixtures showed a worse behavior than the reference one, composed only by limestone aggregates. However, if correctly designed, balancing the percentage of natural aggregate replacement, these mixtures could represent suitable and durable solution for base and sub-base pavement layers.

Recently, interest has been rising with respect to this molecule because of its outstanding physicochemical properties, particularly applicable to the design and development of luminescent materials, hybrid sensor systems, and photodynamic therapy devices for the treatment of cancer cells and bacteria. More recently, our research group has been finding evidence for the possibility of preserving these important properties of substrates containing chlorophyll covalently incorporated within solid pore matrices, such as SiO2, TiO2 or ZrO2 synthesized through the sol-gel process. In this work, we study the optical properties of silica xerogels organo-modified on their surface with allyl and phenyl groups and containing different concentrations of chlorophyll bonded to the pore walls, in order to optimize the fluorescence that these macrocyclic species displays in solution. The intention of this investigation was to determine the maximum chlorophyll a concentration at which this molecule can be trapped inside the pores of a given xerogel and to ascertain if this pigment remains trapped as a monomer, a dimer, or aggregate. Allyl and phenyl groups were deposited on the surface of xerogels in view of their important effects on the stability of the molecule, as well as over the fluorescence emission of chlorophyll; however, these organic groups allow the trapping of either chlorophyll a monomers or dimers. The determination of the above parameters allows finding the most adequate systems for subsequent in vitro or in vivo studies. The characterization of the obtained xerogels was performed through spectroscopic absorption, emission and excitation spectra. These hybrid systems can be employed as mimics of natural systems; the entrapment of chlorophyll inside pore matrices indicates that it is possible to exploit some of the most physicochemical properties of trapped chlorophyll for diverse technological applications.

Here, we propose a high-energy organic cathode using a quinone-derivative, C6Cl4O2, for use in sodium-ion batteries, which boasts one of the highest average voltages among organic electrodes in sodium batteries (similar to 2.72 V vs Na\/Na+). It also utilizes a two-electron transfer to provide an energy of 580 Wh kg(-1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the introduction of electronegative elements into the quinone structure significantly increased the sodium storage potential and thus enhanced the energy density of the electrode, the latter being substantially higher than previously known quinone-derived cathodes. The cycle stability of C6Cl4O2 was enhanced by incorporating the C6Cl4O2 into a nanocomposite with a porous carbon template. This prevented the dissolution of active molecules into the surrounding electrolyte.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"The lysis and regrowth of toxic cyanobacteria during storage of achitosan-aluminium chloride composite coagulated sludge: implications for drinking water sludge treatment","Abstract":"Coagulation is a key unit operation for cyanobacterial cell removal; however, the potential danger of cyanobacterial cells transferred into sludge is not well understood. In this study, the fate of Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) and secondary metabolites in chitosan-aluminium chloride (CTSAC) coagulated cyanobacteria-laden sludge were investigated during the sludge storage period. The extracellular microcystins (MCs) can be adsorbed onto the CTSAC flocs for six days with a reduced biodegradation rate. Less M. aeruginosa cell lysis was observed in the coagulated system than in the natural cell system, due to the protection of M. aeruginosa by the CTSAC. Furthermore, the residual Al content decreased in the cyanobacteria-laden sludge supernatant. The amount of extracellular organic matter (EOM) stayed low in the coagulated system for four days. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis showed that coexisting bacteria reduced in the sludge during the initial four days storage time. Interestingly, the CTSAC degradation favored the growth of the M. aeruginosa cells. This study will be helpful for better understanding and managing secondary metabolite pollution problems related to coagulation-generated cyanobacteria-laden sludge during the sludge supernatant recycling process. The use of CTSAC composite coagulant is of practical value in reducing secondary pollution during cyanobacteria-laden sludge storage.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Synthesis of double-shelled sea urchin-like yolk-shell Fe3O4\/TiO2\/Au microspheres and their catalytic applications","Abstract":"Double-shelled sea urchin-like yolk-shell Fe3O4\/TiO2\/Au microspheres were successfully synthesized through loading Au nanoparticles on the Fe3O4\/TiO2 support by a in situ reduction of HAuCl4 with NaBH4 aqueous solution. These microspheres possess tunable cavity size, adjustable shell layers, high structural stability and large specific surface area. The Au nanoparticles of approximately 5 nm in diameter were loaded both on the TiO2 nanofibers and inside the cavities of sea urchin-like yolk-shell Fe3O4\/TiO2 microspheres. The sea urchin-like structure composed of TiO2 nanofibers ensure the good distribution of the Au nanoparticles, while the novel double-shelled yolk-shell structure guarantees the high stability of the Au nanoparticles. Furthermore, the Fe3O4 magnetic core facilitates the convenient recovery of the catalyst by applying an external magnetic field.

Arrays with as many as 225 emitters and with emitter density as large as 100 emitters cm(-2) were characterized using a solution of dissolved PEO in water and ethanol. Devices with emitter density as high as 25 emitters cm(-2) deposit uniform imprints comprising fibers with diameters on the order of a few hundred nanometers. Mass flux rates as high as 417 g hr(-1) m(-2) were measured, i.e., four times the reported production rate of the leading commercial free-surface electrospinning sources. Throughput increases with increasing array size at constant emitter density, suggesting the design can be scaled up with no loss of productivity. Devices with emitter density equal to 100 emitters cm(-2) fail to generate fibers but uniformly generate electrosprayed droplets. For the arrays tested, the largest measured mass flux resulted from arrays with larger emitter separation operating at larger bias voltages, indicating the strong influence of electrical field enhancement on the performance of the devices. Incorporation of a ground electrode surrounding the array tips helps equalize the emitter field enhancement across the array as well as control the spread of the imprints over larger distances.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Electrospun Nanofibrous Membranes of Polyacrylonitrile\/Halloysite with Superior Water Filtration Ability","Abstract":"The necessity of benefiting a breakthrough in filtration technology has led to increasing attention in advanced functional nanosized materials such as nanofibers for filtering devices as a solution for providing water at lower energy costs. In this study, electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibrous membranes were reinforced by 1, 2, and 3% w\/w of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) in order to improve their mechanical properties, thermal stability and water filtration performance for the possible application as water filtration membranes. Morphological analysis revealed the highly porous and nanofibrous structure of membranes which further confirmed by surface area analysis (BET). Incorporation of HNTs enhanced the mechanical properties of the membranes such as tensile strength and elongation at break (especially at 1% w\/w HNTs) while resulted in significant improvement of their thermal properties. Moreover, PAN\/HNTs membranes showed excellent oil\/water separation performance, while incorporation of HNTs led to increase in water flux rate, which is considered as a key point in water filtration membranes. Additionally, heavy metal ion adsorption performance of the membranes showed a significant increase by incorporation of 3% w\/w HNTs.

Nevertheless, to effectively grow them in various forms toward objective applications, limitations have often been met to achieving high growth rate, simplicity of method and controllability of growing processes simultaneously. In this work, we have grown a uniform CdSe layer on ZnO\/CdS nanorod arrays by a novel in situ photo-assisted chemical deposition method. The morphology and quality of the as-formed material could be significantly influenced by tuning the optical parameters of the injected light. Due to the effect of injected light on the key reactions during the growth, a modified natural light with removal of the UV and IR components seems to be more suitable than monochromic light. An efficiency of 3.59% was achieved without any additional treatment, significantly higher than the efficiency of 2.88% of the sample by conventional CBD method under similar conditions with growth rate one order of magnitude higher. In general, the result has suggested its potential importance for other compound materials and opto-electronic devices.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Predicting Single-Layer Technetium Dichalcogenides (TcX2, X = S, Se) with Promising Applications in Photovoltaics and Photocatalysis","Abstract":"One of the least known compounds among transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is the layered triclinic technetium dichalcogenides (TcX2, X = S, Se). In this work, we systematically study the structural, mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of TcS2 and TcSe2 monolayers based on density functional theory (DFT). We find that TcS2 and TcSe2 can be easily exfoliated in a monolayer form because their formation and cleavage energy are analogous to those of other experimentally realized TMDCs monolayer. By using a hybrid DFT functional, the TcS2 and TcSe2 monolayers are calculated to be indirect semiconductors with band gaps of 1.91 and 1.69 eV, respectively. However, bilayer TcS2 exhibits direct-bandgap character, and both TcS2 and TcSe2 monolayers can be tuned from semiconductor to metal under effective tensile\/compressive strains. Calculations of visible light absorption indicate that 2D TcS2 and TcSe2 generally possess better capability of harvesting sunlight compared to single-layer MoS2 and ReSe2, implying their potential as excellent light-absorbers. Most interestingly, we have discovered that the TcSe2 monolayer is an excellent photocatalyst for splitting water into hydrogen due to the perfect fit of band edge positions with respect to the water reduction and oxidation potentials. Our predictions expand the two-dimensional (2D) family of TMDCs, and the remarkable electronic\/optical properties,of monolayer TcS2 and TcSe2 will place them among the most promising 2D TMDCs for renewable energy application in the future.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Intramolecular Didehydro-Diels-Alder Reaction and Its Impact on the Structure-Function Properties of Environmentally Sensitive Fluorophores","Abstract":"CONSPECTUS: Reaction discovery plays a vital role in accessing new chemical entities and materials possessing important function.(1) In this Account, we delineate our reaction discovery program regarding the [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of styrene-ynes. In particular, we highlight our studies that lead to the realization of the diverging reaction mechanisms of the intramolecular didehydro-Diels-Alder (IMDDA) reaction to afford dihydronaphthalene and naphthalene products. Formation of the former involves an intermolecular hydrogen atom abstraction and isomerization, whereas the latter is formed via an unexpected elimination of H-2. Forming aromatic compounds by a unimolecular elimination of H-2 offers an environmentally benign alternative to typical oxidation protocols. We also include in this Account ongoing work focused on expanding the scope of this reaction, mainly its application to the preparation of cyclopenta[b]naphthalenes. Finally, we showcase the synthetic utility of the IMDDA reaction by preparing novel environmentally sensitive fluorophores. The choice to follow this path was largely influenced by the impact this reaction could have on our understanding of the structure function relationships of these molecular sensors by taking advantage of a de novo construction and functionalization of the aromatic portion of these compounds. We were also inspired by the fact that, despite the advances that have been made in the construction of small molecule fluorophores, access to rationally designed fluorescent probes or sensors possessing varied and tuned photophysical, spectral, and chemical properties are still needed. To this end, we report our studies to correlate fluorophore structure with photophysical property relationships for a series of solvatochromic PRODAN analogs and viscosity-sensitive cyanoacrylate analogs. The versatility of this de novo strategy for fluorophore synthesis was demonstrated by showing that a number of functional groups could be installed at various locations, including handles for eventual biomolecule attachment or water-solubilizing groups. Further, biothiol sensors were designed, and we expect these to be of general utility for the study of lipid dynamics in cellular membranes and for the detection of protein-binding interactions, ideal applications for these relatively hydrophobic fluorophores. Future studies will be directed toward expanding this chemistry-driven approach to the rational preparation of fluorophores with enhanced photophysical and chemical properties for application in biological systems.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Engineering of multi-shelled SnO2 hollow microspheres for highly stable lithium-ion batteries","Abstract":"Uniform multi-shelled SnO2 hollow microspheres were synthesized through a sequential hard template method, and their electrochemical properties were investigated for their use as anodes for lithium-ion batteries.

The mechanical hardness and ordered structure of aluminothermally reduced materials are found to be dependent on the surface contact between aluminum and silica reactants. By heating the silica films in a close contact with aluminum, the silica films undergo a surface aluminothermic reduction to generate photonic mesoporous glasses with enhanced mechanical hardness. The aluminothermic reduction of the silica is significantly enhanced when the reactants are in direct contact, transforming the helicoidal mesoporous silica films into colorful, stiff alumina\/silicon replicas. Iridescent mesoporous films of corundum and corundum\/silicon nanostructures are obtained from the alumina\/silicon composites by selective etching of impurities. Our findings demonstrate that the aluminothermic reduction of silica is a simple process to improve the mechanical strength of chiroptical mesoporous glasses and is also a new one-step hard templating of hierarchically mesoporous corundum-based nanomaterials.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Rectified Proton Grotthuss Conduction Across a Long Water-Wire in the Test Nanotube of the Polytheonamide B Channel","Abstract":"A hydrogen-bonded Water-chain in a nanotube is highly proton conductive, and examining the proton flux under electric fields is crucial to understanding the one-dimensional Grotthuss conduction. Here, we exploited a nanotube-forming natural product, the peptide polytheonamide B (pTB), to examine proton conduction mechanisms at a single-molecule level. The pTB nanotube has a length of similar to 40 A that spans the membrane and a uniform inner diameter of 4 A that holds a single-file water-chain. Single-channel proton currents were measured using planar lipid bilayers in various proton concentrations and membrane potentials (+\/- 400, mV). We found, surprisingly, that the current+voltage curves were asymmetric with symmetric proton concentrations in both solutions across the membrane (rectification). The proton flux from the C-terminal to the N-terminal end was 1.6 tithes higher than that from the opposite. At lower proton concentrations, the degree of rectification was attenuated, but with the addition of a pH-buffer (dichloroaeetate) that supplies protons near the entrance, the rectification emerged. These results indicate that the permeation processes inside the pore generate the rectification, which is masked at low concentrations by the diffusion-limited access of protons to the pore entrance. The permeation processes were characterized by a discrete-state Markov model, in which hops of a proton followed by water-chain turnovers were implemented. The optimized model revealed that the water-chain turnover exhibited unusual, voltage dependence, and the distinct voltage-dependencies of the forward and backward transition rates yielded the rectification. The pTB nanotube serves as a rectified proton conductor, and the design principles can be exploited for proton-conducting materials.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Two Different Approaches for Oral Administration of Voriconazole Loaded Formulations: Electrospun Fibers versus beta-Cyclodextrin Complexes","Abstract":"In this work, a comparison between two different preparation methods for the improvement of dissolution rate of an antifungal agent is presented.

The electrochemical behavior of Hb-AuNCs in the composite film was studied in phosphate buffer solution of pH 7.4 and a pair of quasi-reversible redox peak attributed to the electrode reaction of Hb's Fe(III)\/Fe(II) redox couple was observed. The FTIR and UV-vis spectroscopy indicated that Hb entrapped in the composite film possesses substantial changes in its secondary structure so that it provided a high peroxidase-like enzyme activity attributing to the excellent electrical conductivity of the encapsulated gold nanoclusters. The AuNCs found to play a critical role as conductive holder and accumulator of redox active centers at the surface of GCEs. The fabricated biosensor showed fast response, acceptable stability, excellent sensitivity, and high electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of hydrogen peroxide.

Spurred primarily by the urgent imperative of replacing hexavalent chromium but also driven by concerns regarding the environmental impact of organic solvents, materials criticality considerations, the need to maintain structural integrity and function under extreme environments, and a renewed impetus towards lightweighting, the design of new coating concepts has seen an explosion of activity. We discuss varying modes of corrosion inhibition and the drive towards multicomponent nanostructured coatings that synergistically unite multiple modes of corrosion inhibition within a single coating system. Nanocomposite coatings in which nanoparticles of one phase are dispersed within a continuous phase, usually a polymeric matrix, provide a modular design approach to multifunctional coatings provided fundamental challenges such as dispersion and compatibility can be resolved. By dint of their high surface-to-volume ratios, the incorporation of nanoparticles profoundly modifies the adjacent polymeric matrix, giving rise to an 'interphase' region with modified properties, at relatively low filler loadings. The implications of incorporating metallic, porous metal oxide, and carbon nanomaterials (graphene and carbon nanotubes) within polymeric matrices are explored with an emphasis on active corrosion inhibition. The availability of high-quality nanoparticles that are either electroactive (e.g., metals, graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc.) or are capable of serving as reservoirs for active corrosion inhibitors (e.g., porous silicon oxide, layered double hydroxides, halloysite) provides unprecedented functionality and opportunities for multifunctional coatings. The review emphasizes mechanistic considerations where these have been elucidated with a view towards developing systematic design principles for corrosion inhibition. The outlook for the future design of multimodal coatings is presented with an emphasis on the emergence of rational design of nanoparticles, advances in nanoparticle surface chemistry, high-throughput testing, materials informatics, multiscale modeling, and integrated computational materials engineering approaches.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Controlled Silylation of Nanofibrillated Cellulose in Water: Reinforcement of a Model Polydimethylsiloxane Network","Abstract":"A comparative approach for the surface silylation of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) in water is proposed through an environmentally friendly sol-gel route based on alkoxysilanes.

BB flocculation of lignin, a bioproduct of biomass conversion to bioethanol, was demonstrated. RESULTSFlocculation of kaolin by BB and HEM increased at acidic pH and in the presence of NaCl. LLC values of HEM and BB were similar to LLC values of cationic and anionic PAM. LLC values of HEM and BB were 18-20-fold higher than that of PDDMAC. WA values of BB and HEM were similar to those of PDADMAC, cationic PAM, and anionic PAM. For lignin flocculation, the ratio of LLC for BB\/PDADMAC was 20-38, but the ratio of WA for BB\/PDADMAC was > 3.6. For kaolin and lignin flocculation, DC values were similar for all flocculants.

In here, we explore a set of hydrogels formed of selectively desulfated heparin derivatives and star-shaped poly(ethylene glycol) with respect to VEGF binding and release and anticoagulant activity. As a proof of concept, supportive effects on migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were studied in vitro and the promotion of wound healing was followed in genetically diabetic (db\/db) mice. Our data demonstrate that the release of VEGF from the hydrogels is modulated in dependence on the GAG sulfation pattern.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to measure the contents of the substructures of lignins. The results indicated that the alkaline organosolv extraction released a higher yield of lignin (17.7%, based on lignin in the raw material) than dioxane and alkaline solution extractions. Small amounts of carbohydrates (0.79%, w\/w) were detected in the OL fraction, suggesting a significant cleavage of alpha-ether bonds between lignin and carbohydrates in the alkaline organosolv fractionation process.

Compared with the CON group, the ET group exhibited a significant increase in triglycerides, total cholesterol and the presence of lipid droplets in the liver, and a decrease in fat mass, which were all attenuated by KRG supplementation in adose-dependent manner.

In addition, the ESMP greatly improved the osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblast cells compared to PH10 and PLA in terms of ALP enzyme activity, immunofluorescence staining, and relative gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). These intelligent SMPs and electroactive SMP with strong mechanical properties, tunable degradability, good electroactivity, biocompatibility, and enhanced osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells show great potential for bone regeneration.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"DISSIMILAR HIGH-STRENGTH STEELS: FUSION WELDED JOINTS, MISMATCHES, AND CHALLENGES","Abstract":"One of the major obstacles to the use of conventional steels in higher height infrastructure has been their weight. The demand for materials with a good ratio of high strength and light weight has arisen from new challenges inherent in changed working conditions and environments. In recent years, conventional steels have been successfully welded to high-strength steels (HSS). It is expected that demand for dissimilar welding of HSS will grow because of the characteristics of HSS and its diversity. The objectives of this study are to develop a framework for dissimilar high-strength metal welding compatibilities and to provide suitable welding procedure specifications necessary to achieve acceptable weld quality and flawless joints. In addition, the study takes into consideration the effect of high-strength steel manufacturing techniques on welding properties. The methods comprise an experimental review of scientific papers based on dissimilar metal welding experiments of high-strength steels and an analysis of the properties of different HSS grades, and the paper suggests different combinations of steels, electrode selection, welding processes and suitable heat treatments. The results show that dissimilar high-strength steels provide better mechanical joint properties with higher impact toughness resistance and better ductile-to-brittle transition. The corrosion resistance of the heat-affected zone and the weld depend on the alloy elements and the manufacturing of the base metal. Due to their diversity, dissimilar high-strength steels offer advantages in demanding applications such as industrial applications for nuclear plants, equipment operating in challenging environments, higher amplitude lifting devices and sustainable energy production.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Electrospun nanofibers incorporating self-decomposable silica nanoparticles as carriers for controlled delivery of anticancer drug","Abstract":"Drug delivery via electrospun nanofibers represents a new approach to treat tissue damage resulting from cancer or cancer treatment. In this study, we propose a decomposable nanoparticle-incorporated electrospun mat as carrier for anticancer drugs. The anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was initially loaded into SiO2 nanoparticles (DOX@SiO2), and the prepared DOX-loaded nanoparticles were then introduced into a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)\/chitosan (PLGA\/CS) mixed solution to fabricate drug-loaded composite nanofibers (PLGA\/CS\/DOX@SiO2) via electrospinning. The prepared nanoparticles and drug-loaded nanofibers were characterized by various methods, and the results indicated that the DOX@SiO2 nanoparticles were dispersively embedded inside PLGA\/CS nanofibers. The PLGA\/CS\/DOX@SiO2 composite nanofibers showed a sustained and controlled drug release profile. Moreover, the DOX released from the composite nanofibers achieved significant antitumor activity, thereby effectively inhibiting the growth of HeLa cells. Thus, the prepared composite nanofibrous mats containing self-decomposable nanocarriers would be potential candidates for cancer treatment.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Tuning of ZnO 1D nanostructures by atomic layer deposition and electrospinning for optical gas sensor applications","Abstract":"We explored for the first time the ability of a three-dimensional polyacrylonitrile\/ZnO material-prepared by a combination of electrospinning and atomic layer deposition (ALD) as a new material with a large surface area-to enhance the performance of optical sensors for volatile organic compound (VOC) detection. The photoluminescence (PL) peak intensity of these one-dimensional nanostructures has been enhanced by a factor of 2000 compared to a flat Si substrate. In addition, a phase transition of the ZnO ALD coating from amorphous to crystalline has been observed due to the properties of a polyacrylonitrile nanofiber template: surface strain, roughness, and an increased number of nucleation sites in comparison with a flat Si substrate. The greatly improved PL performance of these nanostructured surfaces could produce exciting materials for implantation in VOC optical sensor applications.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Enhanced gas sensing properties of SnO2: The role of the oxygen defects induced by quenching","Abstract":"Oxygen defects have been considered to play an important role on the gas sensing properties of the sensor.

Previous studies demonstrated that E1 is inhibited by covalent modification of reactive cysteines contained within the ubiquitin-binding groove and by conditions that increase oxidative stress and deplete cellular antioxidants. In this study, we determined the relative contribution of covalent adduction and oxidative stress to E1 inhibition produced by ziram and sodium N,N-dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMDC) in HEK293 cells. Although no dithiocarbamate-derived E1 adducts were identified on E1 using shotgun LC\/MS\/MS for either ziram or DMDC, both dithiocarbamates significantly decreased E1 activity, with ziram demonstrating greater potency. Ziram increased intracellular levels of zinc and copper, DMDC increased intracellular levels of only copper, and both dithiocarbamates enhanced oxidative injury evidenced by elevated levels of protein carbonyls and expression of heme oxygenase-1. To assess the contribution of intracellular copper transport to E1 inhibition, coincubations were performed with the copper chelator triethylenetetramine hydrochloride (TET). TET significantly protected E1 activity for both of the dithiocarbamates and decreased the associated oxidative injury in HEK293 cells as well as prevented dithiocarbamate-mediated lipid peroxidation assayed using an ethyl aracidonate micelle system. Because TET did not completely ameliorate intracellular transport of copper or zinc for ziram, TET apparently maintained E1 activity through its ability to diminish dithiocarbamate-mediated oxidative stress. Experiments to determine the relative contribution of elevated intracellular zinc and copper were performed using a metal free incubation system and showed that increases in either metal were sufficient to inhibit E1. To evaluate the utility of the HEK293 in vitro system for screening environmental agents, a series of additional pesticides and metals was assayed, and eight agents that produced a significant decrease and five that produced a significant increase in activated E1 were identified. These studies suggest that E1 is a sensitive redox sensor that can be modulated by exposure to environmental agents and can regulate downstream cellular processes.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Facile Preparation of Antifouling Hollow Fiber Membranes for Sustainable Osmotic Power Generation","Abstract":"Organic fouling in the membrane support is one of the major causes for the flux decline and low efficiency in the pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) process for osmotic power generation, especially when the fouling is complicated by inorganic salt ions. A facile method to fabricate antifouling hollow fiber membranes was demonstrated in this study, which employed the readily available poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as the modification agent. The poly(ether sulfone) (PES) support for the thin film composite (TFC) membranes was first coated by polydopamine (PDA) and then coated with PVA with the aid of glutaraldehyde (GA). PDA was found to detach from the support in the first 2 h and gradually stabilized at pH 2, verifying its applicability for PRO processes. In addition, the existence of a PVA layer was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is important to note that by controlling the reaction conditions, the water flux and salt reverse flux in the PRO process were not sacrificed, proving that the modification can well maintain the porous structure of the support. The modified membranes showed significantly improved fouling resistance to not only alginate but also complex alginate-calcium solutions. The water flux remained similar to 80% instead of similar to 64% in the latter case. Moreover, much of the fouling was converted from irreversible to reversible, which helped enhance the efficiency of physical cleaning to similar to 90%, and hence improved the sustainability of the PRO process.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Synthesis of conducting polymer nanospheres of high electrochemical activity","Abstract":"We propose a novel approach to obtain conducting polymer nanoparticles with high electrochemical activity and a narrow size distribution.

The different parameters affecting the adsorption capacity of the synthesized material such as contact time (30-270 min), pH (3-7), adsorbent dosage (5-10 g per 50 mL of wet beads), and initial Cu(II) concentration (50-450 mg\/L) were investigated. Of all of the variables, the solution pH has the most significant effect on the adsorption capacity, particularly in the range of 4-6. Response surface methodology was used for modeling and optimizing the uptake process. While the experimental data were well described by the pseudo-second-order model, the adsorption isotherms were better fitted by the Langmuir equation. The results revealed that the maximum removal percentage was 92.6% from the initial Cu(II) concentration (150 mg\/L) at pH 6, adsorbent dose (8.0 g\/50 mL), and contact time (210 min).

However, because graphene is chemically inert, it is difficult to precisely assemble inorganic nanomaterials on pristine graphene(2,11-16). Previous techniques(2,3) based on dangling bonds of damaged graphene(11,17-20), intermediate seed materials(11,15,16,21,22) and vapour-phase deposition at high temperature(12-14,23-25) have only formed randomly oriented or poorly aligned inorganic nanostructures. Here, we show that inorganic nanowires of gold(I) cyanide can grow directly on pristine graphene, aligning themselves with the zigzag lattice directions of the graphene. The nanowires are synthesized through a self-organized growth process in aqueous solution at room temperature, which indicates that the inorganic material spontaneously binds to the pristine graphene surface.

A 40-fold concentration of anionic molecules dosed in aerosol form on a substrate to a small region at the center of a radially symmetric cationic gradient was observed. The separation of mixtures of charged dye molecules was demonstrated using a boronic acid-to-cationic gradient where one molecule was attracted to the boronic acid end of the gradient, and the other to the cationic end of the gradient. Theoretical and computational analysis provides a quantitative description of such anisotropic molecular transport, and reveals that the gradient-imposed drift velocity is in the range of hundreds of nanometers per second, comparable to the transport velocities of biomolecular motors. This general concept of enthalpy gradient-directed molecular transport should enable the autonomous processing of a diversity of chemical species.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Magnetic solid-phase extraction based on ferroferric oxide nanoparticles doubly coated with chitosan and beta-cyclodextrin in layer-by-layer mode for the separation of ibuprofen","Abstract":"A novel and environmentally-friendly magnetic adsorbent consisting of ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles, beta-cyclodextrin and chitosan was successfully fabricated by layer-by-layer methodology and applied in the magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) of ibuprofen. The adsorption results demonstrated that ibuprofen extraction was significantly pH dependent and the optimal pH value was 5.0, which was mainly ascribed to the electrostatic interaction and inclusion complexes between the adsorbent and ibuprofen. The adsorption kinetics of ibuprofen was found to follow a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic data for ibuprofen adsorption were fitted well by the Freundlich model and the Freundlich constant indicated it was a favorable process. The thermodynamic parameters suggested that the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous in nature. Based on the adsorption research, the main factors affecting the MSPE procedure were optimized, including desorption conditions, amount of adsorbents and eluent volume. Under the optimal conditions, the enrichment factor was 182.56. Moreover, the feasibility of the proposed procedure was demonstrated with the extraction and enrichment of ibuprofen from an environmental water sample, and the results indicated that the complex composition of the investigated object did not significantly affect the selectivity of the extraction process.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Cathodically induced antimony for rechargeable Li-ion and Na-ion batteries: The influences of hexagonal and amorphous phase","Abstract":"Cathodic corrosion, a green electrochemical method, has been employed to obtain Sb nanomaterials utilized as anode material for lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries.

Multi lamellar stacking of GO and CTAB layers persists in all GO:CTAB assemblies exhibiting structural order. While driven by hydrophobic interactions between the hydrocarbon tails, the CTAB layer displays a series of structural transitions from a Mayer with in-plane ordering to a more fluidic bilayer and to an interdigitated monolayer. Interaction between GO and CTAB layers shows domination by electrostatics, and osmotic stress studies indicate the absence of continuous hydration layers in GO:CTAB assemblies. Adding salt increases the interlayer spacing by intercalating between GO and CTAB layers, and this ion layer can be expelled by high osmotic stress.

We focus on a transient instability that can be observed when the direction of applied flow is suddenly reversed, which induces compressive forces on the vesicle interface, and small-scale interface perturbations known as wrinkles develop. These wrinkles are driven by regions of negative elastic tension on the membrane. Using a stochastic immersed boundary method with a biophysically motivated choice of thermal fluctuations, we investigate the wrinkling dynamics numerically. Different from deterministic wrinkling dynamics, thermal fluctuations lead to symmetry-breaking wrinkling patterns by exciting higher order modes. This leads to more rapid and more realistic wrinkling dynamics. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data by Kantsler et al. [Kantsler et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2007, 99, 17802]. We compare the nonlinear simulation results with perturbation theory, modified to account for thermal fluctuations. The strength of the applied flow strongly influences the most unstable wavelength characterizing the wrinkles, and there are significant differences between the results from perturbation theory and the fully nonlinear simulations, which suggests that the perturbation theory misses important nonlinear interactions. Strikingly, we find that thermal fluctuations actually have the ability to attenuate variability of the characteristic wavelength of wrinkling by exciting a wider range of modes than the deterministic case, which makes the evolution less constrained and enables the most unstable wavelength to emerge more readily. We further find that thermal noise helps prevent the vesicle from rotating if it is misaligned with the direction of the applied extensional flow.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Solar Hydrogen Production Using Carbon Quantum Dots and a Molecular Nickel Catalyst","Abstract":"Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are established as excellent photosensitizers in combination with a molecular catalyst for solar light driven hydrogen production in aqueous solution.

The CQDs displayed activity in the visible region beyond lambda > 4:55 Am and maintained their full photocatalytic, activity for at least 1 day under full Solar spectrum irradiation. A high quantum efficiency of 1.4% was recorded for the noble- and toxic-metal free photocatalytic system. Thus, CQDs are shown to be a highly sustainable light absorbing material for photocatalytic schemes, which are not limited by cost, toxicity, or lack of scalability. The photocatalytic hybrid system was limited by the lifetime of the molecular catalyst, and intriguingly, no photo catalytic activity Was observed using the CQDs and 3d transition metal salts or platinum precursors: This observation highlights the advantage of using a molecular catalyst over commonly used:heterogeneous catalysts in this photocatalytic system.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Silica nanofibrous membranes with ultra-softness and enhanced tensile strength for thermal insulation","Abstract":"Novel silica nanofibrous (SNF) membranes with ultra-softness and enhanced tensile strength were prepared for the first time via an electrospinning technique with a sol-gel solution containing NaCl. By employing NaCl incorporation, the bonding structure was formed between silica nanofibers, which significantly enhanced the tensile strength of the SNF membranes from 3.2 to 5.5 MPa. Meanwhile, the morphology and mechanical properties of the SNF membranes can be finely controlled by tuning the calcination temperature and varying the NaCl content in the precursor solution. Additionally, the proposed mechanism of the softness of the SNF membranes was discussed by in situ SEM analysis during the bending and recovery process. Furthermore, the as-prepared SNF membranes with ultra-softness of 40 mN and relative high tensile strength of 5.5 MPa exhibit an ultra-low thermal conductivity of 0.0058 W m(-1) K-1, even lower than air, which suggested them to be promising candidates for bunker clothing. This novel method also provides a new insight into the design and development of other soft ceramic nanofibrous membranes with high tensile strength for various applications.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Preparation of colorimetric hydrogel beads for hydrofluoric acid detection","Abstract":"Colorimetric HF-sensitive hydrogel beads were prepared using alginate hydrogel as a host matrix and a pyrocatechol violet (PV)-titanium(IV) bis(ammonium lactato)dihydroxide (TALH) complex as a HF-sensing dye.

The combined effects of pyrolysis and etching temperature were studied with regard to the change in the composition of the material after etching as well as the microstructure of the produced hierarchically porous material. Upon removal of Si from amorphous SiCN, carbon and nitrogen, which are not bonded together in the starting material, react, creating new C-N bonds. The removal of silicon also gives rise to a high amount of micropores and hence a high specific surface area, which can be beneficial for the functionality of the carbonaceous material produced. The mesoporous structure of the aerogel allows us to complete the etching at low temperature, which was found to be a crucial parameter to maintain a high amount of nitrogen in the material. The combination of a high amount of micropores and the mesopore transport system is beneficial for adsorption processes due to the combination of a high amount of adsorption sites and effective transport properties of the material. The N-CDC aerogels were characterized by nitrogen physisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetry (TG\/DTA), and infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT) and they were evaluated as CO2 absorbers and as electrodes for electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs).","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Pectin\/Al2O3-ZrO2 core\/shell bead sorbent for fluoride removal from aqueous solution","Abstract":"A novel sorbent of pectin\/Al2O3-ZrO2 core\/shell beads for fluoride removal was prepared via a coaxial electrostatic spinning device, and its fluoride removal performance was investigated in batch experiments.

The adsorption of MG onto the fibers was investigated under ambient conditions by means of UV-Vis spectrophotometry as a function of initial dye concentration and solution pH. Equilibrium data for MG adsorption were well-fitted with the Langmuir isotherm model indicating a monolayer adsorption process. The effect of magnetite nanoparticles on the adsorption efficacy has been also demonstrated by performing the aforementioned studies on fibers that did not contain OA center dot Fe3O4. The obtained results suggested that the presence of embedded magnetite nanoparticles reduces the fiber adsorption efficiency to some extent. Moreover, the thermodynamic parameters determined from adsorption experiments carried out at three different temperatures indicated that the adsorption of MG onto theFe(3)O(4)-free and the Fe3O4-containing fibers is spontaneous and endothermic. Although the presence of Fe3O4 within the fibers disfavored somewhat the adsorption process, nevertheless, the incorporation of the magnetic nanoparticles within these materials assisted their recovery from aqueous solutions by means of an externally applied magnetic field. Desorption of MG from the fibers could be realized upon fiber immersion in alcohol solution, thus allowing the regeneration and re-use of the adsorbents that retained the same adsorption efficiency after multiple regeneration cycles. MG adsorption studies performed in urban wastewater samples by using the PEO\/ PLLA and the PEO\/PLLA\/OA center dot Fe3O4 fibers as adsorbents, demonstrated the potential use of these materials in real wastewater treatment applications.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Integrated Fast Assembly of Free-Standing Lithium Titanate\/Carbon Nanotube\/Cellulose Nanofiber Hybrid Network Film as Flexible Paper-Electrode for Lithium-Ion Batteries","Abstract":"A free-standing lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12)\/carbon nanotube\/cellulose nanofiber hybrid network film is successfully assembled by using a pressure-controlled aqueous extrusion process, which is highly efficient and easily to scale up from the perspective of disposable and recyclable device production.

However, their intrinsic oxygen sensitivity is sometimes an issue. Some of us have recently demonstrated that hydrogenases, the fragile but very efficient biological catalysts of H2 oxidation, can be protected from O-2 damage upon integration into a film of a specifically designed redox polymer. Catalytic oxidation of H-2 produces electrons which reduce oxygen near the film\/solution interface, thus providing a self-activated protection from oxygen [Plumere et al., Nat Chem. 2014, 6, 822-827]. Here, we rationalize this protection mechanism by examining the time-dependent distribution of species in the hydrogenase\/polymer film, using measured or estimated values of all relevant parameters and the numerical and analytical solutions of a realistic reaction-diffusion scheme. Our investigation sets the stage for optimizing the design of hydrogenase-polymer films, and for expanding this strategy to other fragile catalysts.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Electrospinning of doped and undoped-polyaniline\/poly(vinylidene fluoride) blends","Abstract":"Electrospun mats have been prepared by blending emeraldine base (EB) or DBSA-doped polyaniline (PANI.DBSA) with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF).

The effect of PANI.DBSA and EB content on the properties of PVDF solution and fibers morphology was investigated. The addition of either doped or undoped PANI increases the viscosity of the PVDF solution, but the ionic conductivity was. changed significantly by adding doped PANI. The PVDF\/EB fibers manifested a core-sheath structure, while PANI agglomerates were homogeneously distributed in the PVDF\/PANI.DBSA. This morphology associated to the high porosity of mat resulted in insulating mats, even when 23 wt% of PANI salt was used and high doping levels were achieved. The PVDF\/EB mats obtained from electrospinning displayed a considerable doping level, indicating that the electrical field could induce the protonation of PANI. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To elucidate these mechanisms of interaction, supported phospholipid bilayers (SPBs) are commonly used as models of cell: membranes. However, SPBs are soft thin films, and, as such, their properties can be significantly affected by the underlying substrate. Free-floating cell membranes would be best modeled by weakly adhered SPBs; thus, we propose a method for tailoring the interfacial interaction of an electrically charged SPB-substrate system based on modulations in the solution chemistry. Using the dissipation signal of the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), we show that the method can be used to tailor SPB-substrate interactions without the loss of its structural integrity. To demonstrate the application of die method, SPBs are exposed to cationic and anionic polystyrene latex NPs. These studies reveal that the bilayer response to the modulations in the interfacial interaction with its underlying substrate can be used as a sensitive tool to probe the integrity of SPBs upon exposure to NPs. As expected, anionic NPs tend to impart no significant damage to the anionic bilayers, whereas cationic NPs can be detrimental to bilayer integrity. This, is the first report of a QCM-D based method to probe bilayer integrity following exposure to NPs. Importantly, the degree of SPB interaction with its underlying substrate is shown to be a critical factor in the kinetics of bilayer disruption by cationic NPs, whereby weakly adhered bilayers are prone to, significantly faster breakup. Since free-floating cell membranes are better represented by a weakly adhered SPB, the results of this work critically influence paradigms in experimental studies involving SPBs as models for cell membranes.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Propylene glycol-embodying deformable liposomes as a novel drug delivery carrier for vaginal fibrauretine delivery applications","Abstract":"The purpose of this work was to develop and characterize the fibrauretine (FN) loaded propylene glycol-embodying deformable liposomes (FDL), and evaluate the pharmacokinetic behavior and safety of FDL for vaginal drug delivery applications.

By taking advantage of the instantaneousness of magnetic assembly, magnetic colloids were successfully assembled into photonic crystal structures with tunable stop bands in aqueous solution. The Bragg diffraction color could be simply controlled by tuning the strength of the external magnetic field to achieve diffraction covering the entire visible spectrum. An appropriate amount of an ionic initiator, APS, was key in the radical polymerization of the photonic crystal hydrogel film. 0.3 mg mL(-1) of APS was chosen, not only to allow a rapid formation of the polyacrylamide hydrogel, but also to avoid coagulation of these magnetic colloids in the hydrogel. Due to the significantly instantaneous properties of magnetic assembly and radical polymerization, coagulation of these magnetic assemblies owing to their long exposure time to an external magnetic field could be prevented. Therefore, a photonic crystal hydrogel film with a uniform diffraction color could be obtained. Notably, the flexible hydrogel film displayed obvious deformation responsiveness. The diffraction light got red-shifted as the level of deformation rose. The achievement in immobilization demonstrates the system to be a major stride toward practical applications in responsive photonic materials.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Evaluation of Glycerol Profiles in Sugarcane Spirits (Cachacas)","Abstract":"A new method for glycerol quantification in sugarcane spirits (cachacas) is proposed, based on sample derivatization using benzoyl chloride followed by solid-phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection analysis.

By means of in situ X-ray diffraction, the tetragonality and polarization of these nanofibers have been determined to gradually decrease with an increasing of the temperature from 50 to 300 K; leading to Obvious, enhancements in UC green band emission of 523 nm (about 43 times) and red hand emission of 656 nth. :(about18 times), in contrast to the decreased green and red Tic intensities in Er-doped BaTiO3 or PTO partide. Moreover, the significant enhancement in the intensity ratio of green to red bands from 0:17 to 0.86 has been achieved, indicating that the emission enhancement is highly wavelength-dependent.

The fouled surface of the PVDF membrane suppressed the adsorption of hydrophobic pollutants due to the improved hydrophilicity, and prevented hydrophilic pollutants from entering the membrane pores due to hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and counterion effects. The higher water flux recovery ratios were observed because the pollutants were withheld on the modified membrane surface due to the cake layer feature of SA, and could be eliminated by simple flushing, leading to less irreversible fouling. The purpose of this article is to provide a novel and effective antifouling mechanism for the solution of the membrane fouling problem in sewage treatment.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Magnetic starch nanocomposite as a green heterogeneous support for immobilization of large amounts of copper ions: heterogeneous catalyst for click synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoles","Abstract":"A new magnetic heterogeneous copper catalyst was prepared by immobilization of copper ions onto a cross-linked polymeric nanocomposite composed of starch grafted polyacrylamide and functionalized Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles.

Experiments were conducted in which the incident flux, time to non-piloted ignition, and back-surface temperature of spruce wood were measured. Measured data were used in combination with a numerical heat transfer model to compute the time-dependent temperature distribution through each specimen, and thereby deduce the surface temperature at ignition. From the 30 specimens tested, the average surface temperature for non-piloted ignition of wood was determined to be 521 +\/- 10 degrees C. From this surface temperature range, the heat transfer model was used to predict the range of time over which non-piloted ignition was likely to occur for a given time-varying exposure. This procedure was found to produce excellent predictions of ignition time for the time-varying exposures considered in this study. In addition, several existing ignition models were considered, and their suitability for predicting the non piloted ignition of wood was assessed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand which parameters can be used to tune release, we used a mathematical model based on simple binding kinetics. A comprehensive asymptotic analysis revealed three characteristic regimes for therapeutic release from affinity-based systems. These regimes can be controlled by diffusion or unbinding kinetics, and can exhibit release over either a single stage or two stages. This analysis fundamentally changes the way we think of controlling release from affinity-based systems and thereby explains some of the discrepancies in the literature on which parameters influence affinity-based release. The rate of protein release from affinity-based systems is determined by the balance of diffusion of the therapeutic agent through the hydrogel and the dissociation kinetics of the affinity pair. Equations for tuning protein release rate by altering the strength (K-D) of the affinity interaction, the concentration of binding ligand in the system, the rate of dissociation (k(off)) of the complex, and the hydrogel size and geometry, are provided. We validated our model by collapsing the model simulations and the experimental data from a recently described affinity release system, to a single master curve. Importantly, this mathematical analysis can be applied to any single species affinity-based system to determine the parameters required for a desired release profile. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Antilipidemic activity of samples was assayed using inhibition of pancreatic lipase. To study the metabolic variability in Capparis species, HPTLC analyses were performed in order to characterize the species through the detection, isolation, and quantitative evaluation of rutin taken as significant chemical marker. The best activity was exerted by C. orientalis accession no. C10 and C. sicula subsp. sicula accession no. C6. The bioactivity evaluation of specific chemical markers, rutin and glucocapparin, led to the identification of a potent antilipidemic compound rutin. The HPTLC analysis showed large variation among the different analyzed samples with respect to rutin concentration. The chemical investigation showed a different composition between the species and between the collection zones. The variations showed by the studied accessions of caper could be attributed to exogenous factors.

The partial substitution of Ni and Mn with Fe in the O3-phase lattice can greatly improve the electrochemical performance and the structural stability. A NaFe0.2Mn0.4Ni0.4O2 cathode with an optimized Fe content of x = 0.2 can deliver an initial reversible capacity of 131 mAh g(1), a reversible capacity greater than 95% over 30 cycles, and a high rate capacity of 86 mAh g(1) at 10 C in a voltage range of 2.04.0 V. The structural characterizations reveal that pristine NaMn0.5Ni0.5O2 and Fe-substituted NaFe0.2Mn0.4Ni0.4O2 lattices underwent different phase transformations from P3 to P3 '' and from P3 to OP2 phases, respectively, at high voltage interval. The as-resulted OP2 phase by Fe substitution has smaller interslab distance (5.13 angstrom) than the P3 '' phase (5.72 angstrom), which suppresses the co-insertion of the solvent molecules, the electrolyte anions, or both and therefore enhances the cycling stability in the high voltage charge. This finding suggests a new strategy for creating cycle-stable transition-metal oxide cathodes for high-performance Na-ion batteries.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Surfactant-induced assembly of enzymatically-stable peptide hydrogels","Abstract":"The secondary structure of peptides in the presence of interacting additives is an important topic of study, having implications in the application of peptide science to a broad range of modern technologies. Surfactants constitute a class of biologically relevant compounds that are known to influence both peptide conformation and aggregation or assembly. We have characterized the secondary structure of a linear nonapeptide composed of a hydrophobic alanine\/phenylalanine core flanked by hydrophilic acid\/amine units. We show that the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) induces the formation of beta-sheets and macroscopic gelation in this otherwise unstructured peptide. Through comparison to related additives, we propose that SDS-induced secondary structure formation is the result of amphiphilicity created by electrostatic binding of SDS to the peptide. In addition, we demonstrate a novel utility of surfactants in manipulating and stabilizing peptide nanostructures. SDS is used to simultaneously induce secondary structure in a peptide and to inhibit the activity of a model enzyme, resulting in a peptide hydrogel that is impervious to enzymatic degradation. These results complement our understanding of the behavior of peptides in the presence of interacting secondary molecules and provide new potential pathways for programmable organization of peptides by the addition of such components.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Improving Efficiency of Blue Organic Light-Emitting Diode with Sulfobutylated Lignin Doped PEDOT as Anode Buffer Layer","Abstract":"Water-soluble alkyl chain sulfobutylated lignosulfonate (ASLS) doped PEDOT was prepared with lignin as raw material.

Their essential roles in the regulation of cellular processes and alteration of protein protein interaction networks have been actively studied. However, phosphorylated proteins are present at low abundance in cells, and ionization of the modified peptides is often suppressed by the more abundant species in mass spectrometry. Effective enrichment techniques are needed to remove the unmodified peptides and concentrate the phosphorylated ones before their identification and quantification. Herein, we prepared ZrO2 nanofibers by electrospinning, a straightforward and easy fabrication technique, and applied them to enrich phosphorylated peptides and proteins. The fibers showed good size homogeneity and porosity and could specifically bind to the phosphorylated peptides and proteins, allowing their separation from the unmodified analogues when present in either simple protein digests or highly complex cell lysates. The enrichment performance was superior to that of the commercially available nanoparticles. Moreover, modifying the solution pH could lead to selective adsorption of proteins with different pI values, suggesting the fibers' potential applicability in charge-based protein fractionation.

RADA16-I was appended with functional motifs containing cell adhesion peptide RGD and neurite outgrowth peptide IKVAV. The two SAPs were specially designed to have opposite net charges at neutral pH, the combination of which created a nanofiber hydrogel (-IKVAV\/-RGD) characterized by significantly higher G' than G '' in a viscoelasticity examination. Circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman measurements were performed to investigate the secondary structure of the designer SAPs, indicating that both the hydrophobic\/hydrophilic properties and electrostatic interactions of the functional motifs play an important role in the self assembling behavior of the designer SAPs. The neural progenitor cells (NPCs)\/stem cells (NSCs) fully embedded in the 3D-IKVAV\/-RGD nanofiber hydrogel survived, whereas those embedded within the RADA 16-I hydrogel hardly survived.

In contrast to all known lignins which are comprised of polyaromatic networks, the PCFA lignin is a linear polymer derived almost totally from caffeyl alcohol monomers linked head to tail into benzodioxane chains via the 'endwise' radical coupling reactions that typify lignification. In this paper we investigate carbon fiber formed from this linear C-lignin and compare it to a Kraft lignin. The PCFA was extracted and electrospun into fibers without additional modification or blending of polymers. Nanoindentation shows an increase in transverse and axial modulus for PCFA carbon by around 250% and 25% respectively as compared to Kraft lignin carbon. Raman spectroscopy results indicate higher graphitic structure for PCFA carbon than that from Kraft lignin, as seen from G\/D ratios of 1.92 vs 1.15 which was supported by XPS and TEM results.

Despite enormous recent development in DNA nanotechnology, very little is known about DNA-membrane interactions at a molecular level. Here we employ biased atomic-scale computer simulations to calculate for the first time the free energy profile for partitioning a DNA molecule into a phospholipid bilayer, a system that is routinely used to mimic the properties of cell membranes. Our findings clearly show that a zwitterionic lipid bilayer represents a repulsive barrier for DNA: the potential of the mean force profile does not develop any local minima upon moving DNA from water into the lipid\/water interface. This energetic barrier can be overcome e.g. via adsorption of divalent calcium ions on the surface of a lipid bilayer, which makes the lipid bilayer effectively cationic. Indeed, our biased molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the corresponding free energy profile for partitioning DNA into a lipid bilayer with adsorbed Ca ions is characterized by a deep minimum. Therefore, the bilayer-bound calcium ions can serve as a trigger of the electrostatic attraction between DNA and zwitterionic phospholipids. In addition, we performed a series of unbiased computer simulations for lipid bilayers with absorbed calcium ions and showed that the initial DNA binding is driven by an overall positive charge of the bilayer, while DNA is stabilized on the bilayer surface by Ca ions that laterally diffuse towards DNA to form tight bridges between phosphate groups of DNA and lipids. Overall, our computational findings contribute to a long-standing problem of interactions of charged nano-objects (such as DNA and DNA-base nanostructures) with cell membranes.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Methyl and Dimethyl o-Xylenyl-Substituted Fullerene Acceptors for Polymer Solar Cells","Abstract":"A series of fullerene derivatives based on methyl- and dimethyl-substituted o-xylenyl groups were synthesized via Diels-Alder reaction from fullerene (C-60) and dienes derived from alpha,alpha'-dibromo-o-xylene derivatives.

In this reported work, an engineering perspective is strategised for the development of medical nanofluids containing functionalised single-wall carbon nanotubes and conjugated cisplatin. These nanofluids were developed by two biocompatible phospholipids. For the first time, the change in TC values of this medical nanofluid was investigated. The change in the drug release was examined before and after dialysis with change in pH and temperature, in vitro. It was found that an increase in temperature leads to higher TC and a decrease in pH provides better thermophysical conditions for the drug release. These findings strongly suggest that TC could be an important parameter in the development of medical nanofluids for cancer treatment.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Who's on base? Revealing the catalytic mechanism of inverting family 6 glycoside hydrolases","Abstract":"In several important classes of inverting carbohydrate-active enzymes, the identity of the catalytic base remains elusive, including in family 6 Glycoside Hydrolase (GH6) enzymes, which are key components of cellulase cocktails for cellulose depolymerization. Despite many structural and kinetic studies with both wild-type and mutant enzymes, especially on the Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) GH6 cellulase (TrCel6A), the catalytic base in the single displacement inverting mechanism has not been definitively identified in the GH6 family. Here, we employ transition path sampling to gain insight into the catalytic mechanism, which provides unbiased atomic-level understanding of key order parameters involved in cleaving the strong glycosidic bond. Our hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM\/MM) simulations reveal a network of hydrogen bonding that aligns two active site water molecules that play key roles in hydrolysis: one water molecule drives the reaction by nucleophilic attack on the substrate and a second shuttles a proton to the putative base (D175) via a short water wire. We also investigated the case where the putative base is mutated to an alanine, an enzyme that is experimentally still partially active. The simulations predict that proton hopping along a water wire via a Grotthuss mechanism provides a mechanism of catalytic rescue. Further simulations reveal that substrate processive motion is 'driven' by strong electrostatic interactions with the protein at the product sites and that the -1 sugar adopts a S-2(O) ring configuration as it reaches its binding site. This work thus elucidates previously elusive steps in the processive catalytic mechanism of this important class of enzymes.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Synthesis of intertwined Zn0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4@CNT composites as a superior anode material for Li-ion batteries","Abstract":"Nanocrystalline ZnFe2O4, Zn0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4, and Zn0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4@CNT composites have been successfully prepared by a facile and high-yield co-precipitation method.

Here, a composite phase change material (PCM) based on graphene and paraffin was designed and prepared through a modified hydrothermal method. Graphene oxide sheets were reduced and self-assembled into three-dimensional graphene aerogels consisting of numerous hollow graphene cells, and paraffin was simultaneously encapsulated into the cells in the form of micrometer-scale droplets during the hydrothermal process. The resulting core-shell-like structured, composite PCM exhibits a high encapsulation ratio of paraffin, large phase change enthalpy, and excellent cycling performance. Due to the unique encapsulated structure and continuous graphene network in the matrix, such a composite PCM holds a good shape-stable property, which prevents the leakage of paraffin above its melting point. In addition, it inherits the intrinsic thermally and electrically conductive nature of the embedded graphene, and thus shows enhanced thermal and electrical conductivity compared to pure paraffin. This novel composite PCM can realize efficient thermal energy storage and demonstrates the potential to be directly used as an actual thermal storage device without containers.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Cyanogel-Derived Formation of 3D Nanoporous SnO2-MxOy (M= Ni, Fe, Co) Hybrid Networks for High-Performance Lithium Storage","Abstract":"Three-dimensional (3D) nanoporous SnO2-MxOy (M= Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.) hybrid networks possess unique compositional and structural features that are beneficial to lithium storage and are thus anticipated to meet the performance requirements of advanced lithium-ion batteries for transportation and stationary energy storage.

In the framework of the \"BIOTERRA\" ANR project, the aim of the study was to develop and characterize an earth based material incorporating plant fibers from both abiotic and biotic points of view. Compressive strength, thermal conductivity and water vapor permeability of this material were determined. Microorganism sampling methods intended for raw materials and cylindrical specimens were optimized, and the microflora profile of these materials was then obtained. The results showed that the straw addition led to a decrease of compressive strength and an increase of thermal insulation. However, it did not influence water vapor permeability coefficient.

The regular gauze masks are used to prevent inhaling the PM2.5 fine particles; however, those masks are not able to filter out the PM2.5 because of the large porosity of the mask materials. Some well-prevented masks usually have poor breathability, which increases other health risks. In this study, a polysulfone based nanofiber for mask filtration material was synthesized by electrospinning. That nanofiber mask material was characterized by SEM, air permeability test, and PM2.5 trapping experiment. The results indicate that nanofiber mask material can efficiently filter out the PM2.5 particles and simultaneously preserve a good breathability. We attribute such improvement to the nanoscaled fibers, having the same porosity as that of regular gauze mask but with extremely reduced local interfiber space.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"In situ catalytic formation of graphene decoration on Na3V2(PO4)(3) particles for ultrafast and long-life sodium storage","Abstract":"Graphene-decorated Na3V2(PO4)(3) (NVP@G) material is synthesized through an in situ catalytic process using the intermediate product component VOx as a catalyst and polyvinyl alcohol as the graphene source.

In the present study, full-length cDNA sequences of seven STAT members, including some splicing variants different from those in mammals, were obtained from Synechogobius hasta. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the seven STAT members were derived from paralogous genes that might have arisen by whole genome duplication (WGD) events during vertebrate evolution. All of these members share similar domain structure compared with those of mammals, and were widely expressed across the tested tissues (brain, gill, heart, intestine, liver, muscle and spleen), but at variable levels. Incubation in vitro of recombinant human leptin changed the intracellular triglyceride (TG) content and mRNA levels of several STATs members, as well as expressions and activities of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Furthermore, Tyrphostin B42 (AG490), a specific inhibitor of the Janus Kinase 2(JAK2)-STAT pathway, partially reversed leptin-induced change on STAT3 and its two spliced isoforms expression, as well as expressions and activities of genes involved in lipid metabolism. As a consequence, the decrease of TG content was also reversed. Thus, our study suggests that STAT3 is the requisite for the leptin signal and the activation of the STAT3 member may account for the leptin-induced changes in lipid metabolism in S. hasta.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Facile synthesis of nitrogen-doped, hierarchical porous carbons with a high surface area: the activation effect of a nano-ZnO template","Abstract":"Hierarchical porous carbons have recently attracted much attention due to their unique features in practical applications, but suffer from the complex and costly synthesis procedure.

During pyrolysis, zinc oxide nanoparticles act as not only a hard template to create mesopores, but also an activating agent to create micropores as well as enlarge the pore sizes of the mesopores, making the carbon possess a developed hierarchical porous structure with a high BET surface area of 2412 m(2) g(-1) and a large pore volume of 3.436 cm(3) g(-1). The activation effect of nano-ZnO was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis, carbon yield, nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements, SEM, TEM and so on.

The resulting polyaniline nanofiber\/graphene oxide films are electrochemically reduced to convert graphene oxide to reduced graphene oxide, as evidenced by a distinctive change in colour and Raman spectra. The architecture of the electrode is highly porous (74% void), which facilitates ion transport.

Conductive Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) mixtures are constructed by modifying with electrically conductive materials. Conductive HMA mixtures would potentially make many technologies applicable to pavements including, but not limited to; thermal electric de-icing of airport runways or highways, cathodic protection of concrete bridge decks, pavement damage sensing, truck weigh-in-motion, and so forth.

The CNF modified HMA mixtures would have the ability to respond to loading. An exploratory investigation for piezoresistive response of CNF modified HMA mixtures under various types of loading, frequencies, and temperatures were evaluated. Stress strain response due to applied load and its relationship with the change in resistivity was discussed. It was found that out of two type of CNF used in the study one provide better piezoresistive response of HMA.

It was observed that the WO3 film based on the wood substrate was composed of 2D nanosheets with an edge length of 580-957 nm and a thickness of about 80 nm and was highly crystallized with a phase-pureness. The UV-vis analysis shows that the sample prepared with the 20% ethanol content responded to ultraviolet radiation of wavelength 270-350 nm very intensively. When the sample was irradiated under UV light (365 nm), there appeared an obvious color difference value (DC). The water contact angle (WCA) measurements demonstrated that the WO3-treated wood surfaces possessed superhydrophilic behavior and then converted to the superhydrophobic property through the octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) treatment.

The CMK-3 was dispersed with chitosan (CS-CMK-3), which contains a large amount of amino groups (-NH2), and the CdSe(aZnS ODs were treated with thioglycolic acid, which contains carboxylic acid groups (-COOH). The layer-by-layer assembling of CdSe(aZnS QDs and CS-CMK-3 achieved through the covalent bonding of -COOH and -NH2 was employed as a photoactive antibody (Ab) immobilization matrix. Improved sensitivity was achieved through the synergistic effect of the excellent electrical conductivity and high specific surface area of CMK-3, as well as the high photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of CdSe@ZnS ODs. The photoexcitation of a CMK-3\/CdSe(aZnS QDs-modified ITO electrode potentiostated at 0 V (vs. Ag\/AgCl) under white light led to a stable anodic photocurrent.

The resulting nanofiber electrodes, with short mass-and charge-transport pathways, improved electrical conductivity, and large contact area exposed to electrolyte, permitting fast diffusional flux of Li ions, explains the improved kinetics of the interfacial charge-ransfer reaction and the diffusivity of the MoS2@C mesoporous nanofibers. It is believed that the integration of MoS2 nanocrystals and mesoporous carbon nanofibers may have a synergistic effect, giving a promising anode, and widening the applicability range into high performance and mass production in the Li-ion battery market.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Responsive Inverse Opal Hydrogels for the Sensing of Macromolecules","Abstract":"Dual responsive inverse opal hydrogels were designed as autonomous sensor systems for (bio)macromolecules, exploiting the analyte-induced modulation of the opal's structural color. The systems that are based on oligo(ethylene glycol) macromonomers additionally incorporate comonomers with various recognition units. They combine a coil-to-globule collapse transition of the LCST type with sensitivity of the transition temperature toward molecular recognition processes. This enables the specific detection of macromolecular analytes, such as glycopolymers and proteins, by simple optical methods. While the inverse opal structure assists the effective diffusion even of large analytes into the photonic crystal, the stimulus responsiveness gives rise to strong shifts of the optical Bragg peak of more than 100nm upon analyte binding at a given temperature. The systems' design provides a versatile platform for the development of easy-to-use, fast, and low-cost sensors for pathogens.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"An ATP-responsive smart gate fabricated with a graphene oxide-aptamer-nanochannel architecture","Abstract":"Here, we report a graphene oxide-aptamer-nanochannel architecture for the fabrication of a novel stimuli-responsive gate.

In this article we reported a novel synthetic compound 2-(3-benzoylthioureido)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[b] thiophene-3-carboxylic acid (ZJ001) that inhibited the SREBP-1c pathway, and effectively reduced hepatic lipid accumulation in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. Methods: A luciferase reporter driven by an SRE-containing promoter transfected into HepG2 cells was used to discover the compound. Two approaches were used to evaluate the lipid-lowering effects of ZJ001: (1) diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice that were treated with ZJ001 (15 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), po) for 7 weeks; and (2) HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes used as in vitro models. Results: ZJ001 (10, 20 mu mol\/L) dose-dependently inhibited the activity of SRE-containing promoter. ZJ001 administration ameliorated lipid metabolism and improved glucose tolerance in DIO mice, accompanied by significantly reduced mRNA levels of SREBP-1C and SREBP-2, and their downstream genes. In HepG2 cells and insulin-treated hepatocytes, ZJ001 (10-40 mu mol\/L) dose-dependently inhibited lipid synthesis, and reduced mRNA levels of SREBP-1C and SREBP-2, and their downstream genes. Furthermore, ZJ001 dose-dependently increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor), and suppressed the phosphorylation of mTOR in insulin-treated hepatocytes. Moreover, ZJ001 increased the ADP\/ATP ratio in insulin-treated hepatocytes, Conclusion: ZJ001 exerts multiple beneficial effects in diet-induced obesity mice. Its lipid-lowering effects may result from the suppression of mTORC1, which regulates SREBP-1c transcription. The results suggest that the SREBP-1c pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of lipid metabolic disorders.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Complex Processing of Industrial Products and Lead-Copper Concentrates","Abstract":"This article describes the modern technologies of processing of industrial products and copper-lead waste products, and their physical and chemical properties as well as laboratory tests for processing slurries and zinc slags. Experiments have shown that the temperature of the melt in the reduction of lead-containing slag should be within 1100-1200 degrees C. The key criteria for separating melting products to different phases are the difference in density, viscosity and surface tension of the melted slag. The separation of the molten slag to the phases and the reduction of the settling time of the melt in the furnace will be promoted by the increasing the density and surface tension of the lead and matte-molten slag, and reduction in viscosity of the latter. The processing of lead-copper-zinc containing sulfide raw material was carried by the reduction smelting method and the purging of melt with a natural gas at a rectangular electric furnace. Dust collection system was connected to the furnace through the duct work. The feedstock loading was carried out through the furnace crown. The purging of melt with natural gas was performed after the melting of the charge using the immersed gas supply tube. The gaseous products were derived from the melting furnace through the flue. The gas supply tube was fitted with a gear system to adjust the depth of the tube immersion. As results of experiments were obtained sharply separable intermediates with a high degree of concentration: lead into lead bullion to 92-94%; copper into matte to 90-91%; zinc to the slag and sublimates to 94-96%. Thus the material costs for processing of copper matte and zinc slag will be reduced and the yield of sublimates consisting primarily of vapor and metallic zinc sulfide will be decreased.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"UV-controlled shape memory hydrogels triggered by photoacid generator","Abstract":"Light-induced shape memory polymers represent a class of stimuli-responsive materials that can recover their permanent shapes from temporarily trapped ones upon exposure to light illumination. Although much effort has been devoted to developing various light-responsive shape memory polymers, fabrication of such a light-responsive shape memory hydrogel still remains a challenge compared to neat polymers in their dry state. Herein, we developed a facile and general strategy to endow conventional hydrogel systems with ultraviolet (UV)-controlled shape memory performance simply using a photoacid generator (PAG) as a trigger. The process involves shape fixity through coordination interaction between imidazole groups and metal ions, and shape recovery by switching off the complexation via PAG photolysis reaction which leads to the protonation of imidazole groups. Furthermore, this convenient strategy is proved to be applicable to other pre-existing hydrogels such as a boronate ester cross-linked melamine-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel. We believe this method could provide a new opportunity with regard to the design and practical application of light-controlled shape memory hydrogels.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Electrochemical study of Magnetite-CH composite carbon paste modified electrode","Abstract":"Magnetite nanoparticles were synthesized by coprecipitation and characterized.

The results show that weight loss of bagasse reduced as temperature of torrefaction increased due to excessive devolatilization. A reduced moisture and volatile matter content as well as improved calorific value were also achieved with increasing temperature of torrefaction. The torrefaction progress was again followed by elemental analysis of the material which showed the presence of C, H, and O in varying proportions depending on torrefaction temperature. The decrease in the weight percentages of O-2 and H-2 as torrefaction reaction temperature increased resulted in the accumulation of C in the solid product. The thermogravimetric analysis conducted established the maximum reactivity temperature of the torrefied material and revealed that the degradation of torrefied sugarcane bagasse was accelerated by thermal treatment of the material prior to analysis. Finally, the study established that torrefaction at 300 degrees C led to a much more degraded material compared to the lower torrefaction reaction temperatures of 200 and 250 degrees C, respectively.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Li-storage performance of binder-free and flexible iron fluoride@graphene cathodes","Abstract":"As flexible devices have become increasingly popular in our daily Life, flexible energy-supply devices, especiay flexible Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), have attracted great attention.

To translate this synergistic therapy into in vivo anticancer therapy and clinical practice, we designed a novel pH-sensitive charge conversion nanocarrier (M-HHG(2)C(18)-L) that contained erlotinib\/DOX combination and produced a sequential staggered drug release for synergistic lung cancer therapy. In this study, a synthetic zwitterionic oligopeptide lipid (1,5-dioctadecyl-L-glutamyl2-histidyl-hexahydrobenzoic acid, HHG(2)C(18)) was used to construct a pH-sensitive lipid bilayer (HHG(2)C(18)-L), which was subsequently applied to coat amino-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN-NH2). Erlotinib and DOX were separately incorporated into HHG(2)C(18)-L and MSN-NH2 respectively to obtain pH-sensitive charge conversion erlotinib\/DOX co-delivery nanoparticles (M-HHG(2)C(18)-L(E + D)). We confirmed that M-HHG(2)C(18)-L(E + D) were able to reverse surface zeta potential from negative to positive at tumor extracellular pH, thus facilitating the targeted cancer cell internalization. Furthermore, as erlotinib was sequestered in the exterior lipid bilayer and the controlled release ability of MSN-NH2, erlotinib released faster than DOX during the cellular transport. Additionally, HHG(2)C(18)-L became more positive at tumor intracellular pH and enhanced Coulombic repulsion with MSN-NH2, leading to increased sequential staggered release of erlotinib and DOX. Due to the pretreatment and time-staggered inhibition of EGFR with erlotinib and the enhanced intracellular release of DOX to the nucleus, the maximized synergistic cell killing effect was achieved. Compared to non-sensitive erlotinib\/DOX co-delivery nanoparticles (M-SPC-L(E + D)) and simultaneous DRUG coadministration. M-HHG(2)C(18)-L(E + D) with sequential staggered drug release and pH-sensitive charge conversional properties showed great synergistic effects in antiproliferation and apoptosis of A549 human cancer cells in vitro.

In order to take the advantage of solar energy, many researchers have investigated artificial photosynthesis systems mimicking the natural photosynthetic enzymatic redox reactions. These redox reactions usually require cofactors, which due to their high cost become a key issue when constructing an artificial photosynthesis system. Combining a photosensitizer and an Rh-based electron mediator (RhM) has been shown to photocatalytically regenerate cofactors. However, maintaining the high concentration of cofactors available for efficient enzymatic reactions requires a high concentration of the expensive RhM; making this process cost prohibitive. We hypothesized that conjugation of an electron mediator to a redox enzyme will reduce the amount of electron mediators necessary for efficient enzymatic reactions. This is due to photocatalytically regenerated NAD(P)H being readily available to a redox enzyme, when the local NAD(P)H concentration near the enzyme becomes higher. However, conventional random conjugation of RhM to a redox enzyme will likely lead to a substantial loss of cofactor regenerating capacity and enzymatic activity. In order to avoid this issue, we investigated whether bioconjugation of RhM to a permissive site of a redox enzyme retains cofactor regenerating capacity and enzymatic activity. As a model system, a RhM was conjugated to a redox enzyme, formate dehydrogenase obtained from Thiobacillus sp. KNK65MA (TsFDH). A RhM-containing azide group was site-specifically conjugated to p-azidophenylalanine introduced to a permissive site of TsFDH via a bioorthogonal strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition and an appropriate linker. The TsFDH-RhM conjugate exhibited retained cofactor regenerating capacity and enzymatic activity.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Supramolecular electrospun nanofibers with high conductivity at ultra-low carbon nanotube content","Abstract":"Complementary supramolecular polymers can efficiently control the arrangement of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in electrospun nanofibers as a means of manipulating the conductivity pathways of CNTs, thus providing a new route to the fabrication of high-performance supramolecular nanofibers with superior electrical conductivity at ultra-low CNT content.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Simple fabrication of Ag nanoparticle-impregnated electrospun nanofibres as SERS substrates","Abstract":"A facile method for the fabrication of electrospun polyurethane (PU) nanofibres impregnated with Ag nanoparticles (NPs) as an efficient and free-standing surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates is reported here.

Herein, we demonstrate that the amide III spectral signals of the protein backbone, generated in the sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, are a powerful tool to probe the protein folding processes within the membrane in situ, in real time, and without exogenous labels. The amide III signals are capable of separating the spectral profiles of the random-coil and alpha-helical structures at the interface. The intensity ratio of coil and helix peaks becomes a prime indicator that allows one to directly capture the dynamical change of the coil helix transition. With this approach, using pardaxin as a model, the influence of lipid charge on the peptide folding degree at the cell membrane surface has been nicely elucidated. It is evident that the negative charge of the lipid increases the folding degree of pardaxin upon interfacial adsorption and promotes the formation of alpha-helical structure during the insertion of peptides into the lipid bilayer. This robust spectral approach can thus greatly enhance our ability to monitor the dynamics of membrane proteins in a real cell environment in situ.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Polyester with Pendent Acetylcholine-Mimicking Functionalities Promotes Neurite Growth","Abstract":"Successful regeneration of nerves can benefit from biomaterials that provide a supportive biochemical and mechanical environment while also degrading with controlled inflammation and minimal scar formation.

Distinct from prior acetylcholine-biomimetic polymers, PSeD-Ach contains both quaternary ammonium and free acetyl moieties, closely resembling native acetylcholine structure. The polymer structure was confirmed via 111 nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Hydrophilicity, charge, and thermal properties of PSeD-Ach were determined by tensiometer, zetasizer, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermal gravimetric analysis, respectively. PC12 cells exhibited the greatest proliferation and neurite outgrowth on PSeD-Ach and laminin substrates, with no significant difference between these groups. PSeD-Ach yielded much longer neurite outgrowth than the control polymer containing ammonium but no the acetyl group, confirming the importance of the entire acetylcholine-like moiety. Furthermore, PSeD-Ach supports adhesion of primary rat dorsal root ganglions and subsequent neurite sprouting and extension. The sprouting rate is comparable to the best conditions from previous report. Our findings are significant in that they were obtained with acetylcholine-like functionalities in 100% repeating units, a condition shown to yield significant toxicity in prior publications. Moreover, PSeD-Ach exhibited favorable mechanical and degradation properties for nerve tissue engineering application. Humidified PSeD-Ach had an elastic modulus of 76.9 kPa, close to native neural tissue, and could well recover from cyclic dynamic compression. PSeD-Ach showed a gradual in vitro degradation under physiologic conditions with a mass loss of 60% within 4 weeks.

However, in natural aquatic environments, especially marine environments, zinc electrodeposits suffer significantly from microbial induced corrosion and biofouling which lead to metal failure. To better confront the microbial induced problems, a biocide-zinc electrodeposit was synthesized based on chelating action. In this paper, nontoxic and biocidal natural polysaccharide, chitosan, was successfully incorporated into the zinc electrodeposit matrix, synthesizing a kind of chitosan-zinc composite electrodeposit. The addition of chitosan in the electrolyte influenced the surface morphology and crystalline structure of the resultant electrodeposits significantly, while a chitosan-zinc chelation complex was also found in the electrodeposits. A synthesis model was proposed in which a chitosan molecule could chelate zinc ions in the electrolyte by means of its N atoms in amino groups and O atoms in hydroxide radicals, which promoted the codeposition of zinc and chitosan during synthesis. Furthermore, remarkably enhanced broad-spectrum bactericidal properties of the chitosan-zinc electrodeposits were revealed through Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shewanella oneidensis exposure. The best antibacterial properties of the resultant electrodeposits were obtained when the chitosan concentration was 0.6 g L-1 in the electrolyte.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Effects of Carbonization Temperature and Component Ratio on Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Effectiveness of Woodceramics","Abstract":"Woodceramics were fabricated in a vacuum through carbonization of wood powder impregnated with phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin.

The monofilaments were elastic and flexible in nature, displaying remarkable elongation and work-to-break values (up to nine times higher than pure PAA-16DGE filaments).

DNP surface-enhanced SSNMR spectroscopy of materials has, however, been limited to studying relatively receptive nuclei, and the particularly rare O-17 nuclide, which is of great interest for materials science, has not been utilized. We demonstrate that advanced O-17 SSNMR experiments can be performed on surface species at natural isotopic abundance using DNP. We use O-17 DNP surface enhanced 2D SSNMR to measure O-17{H-1} HETCOR spectra as well as dipolar oscillations on a series of thermally treated mesoporous silica nanoparticle samples having different pore diameters. These experiments allow for a nonintrusive unambiguous characterization of hydrogen bonding and dynamics at the surface of the material; no other single experiment can give such details about the interactions at the surface.

The GO composites were used to adsorb Nd ions from the aqueous phase due to their quite high BET surface areas. In this work, the GO composites (GO-C4, GO-C6, and GO-C8) showed high adsorption capacities (232.56, 219.78, and 311.53 mg g(-1), respectively) compared to GO (110.99 mg g(-1)) during the removal process and excellent efficiency in removing a high concentration of neodymium ions (1150 mg L-1) from water. The results indicate that the adsorption ability for Nd ions was in the order of GO-C8 > GO-C4 > GO-C6 > GO. The adsorption processes of GO-C4 and GO-C8 were completed within 185 min, whereas that of GO-C6 was achieved within 230 min. Furthermore, controlling the pH value of an aqueous solution in the range of 6, the GO composites exhibited the highest adsorption capacity toward Nd ions. For our process of removing Nd ions, the adsorption data of experiments mostly fit the pseudo-second-order model better than two other models. Four adsorption isotherm models were compared to study the details of the adsorption process, and the results indicated that the Freundlich model is the most suitable for describing the adsorption process of the GO composites. The adsorption mechanisms to remove Nd ions were the electrostatic attraction of Nd ions with hydroxyl functional groups and the complexation process of Nd ions with functional groups on the surface of the GO composite. Moreover, thermodynamic studies indicated that the adsorption behavior of the GO composites towards Nd ions was an endothermic and spontaneous natural process. In general, GO composites could potentially be applied to metal ion removal.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Redox-responsive organometallic hydrogels for in situ metal nanoparticle synthesis","Abstract":"A new class of redox active hydrogels composed of poly(ferrocenylsilane) polyanion and poly(ethylene glycol) chains was assembled, using a copper-free azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition reaction.

A combination consumption of excessive fructose and salt can induce insulin resistance (IR) and hypertension (HT), which are major public health problems around the world. However, the effects of high fructose and salt on systematic metabonome remain unknown, which is very important for revealing the molecular mechanism of IR and HT induced by this dietary pattern. The metabolic profiling in urine, plasma, and fecal extracts from high fructose and salt-fed rats was investigated by use of H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabonomics approach in this study. Multivariate analysis of NMR data showed the effects of high fructose and salt on the global metabonome. The metabolite analysis in urine and fecal extracts showed the time-dependent metabolic changes, which displayed metabonomic progression axes from normal to IR and HT status. The changes of 2-oxoglutarate, creatine and creatinine, citrate, hippurate, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and betaine in urine, together with gut microbiota disorder in feces, were observed at the preliminary formation stage of IR and HT (fourth week). At the severe stage (eighth week), the previously mentioned metabolic changes were aggravated, and the changes of lipid and choline metabolism in plasma suggested the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.

Thus, the development of more efficient fluoride scavenging materials for designing water filters is an immediate task for researchers. beta-Cyclodextrin (beta-CD) amended hydrous ironzirconium hybrid oxide (CHIZO), which is a new type of surface modified highly selective composite in organic-inorganic frameworks, is synthesized and characterized using various state of the art analytical tools, and its efficacy on fluoride removal from an aqueous solution is explored. The agglomerated micro structured composite material has no significant fingerprint such as surface appearance in TEM images and is inclined to possess very poor crystallinity. The BET analysis of CHIZO reveals a surface area of 0.2070 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 0.0476 cm(3) g(-1). The highly pH dependent fluoride adsorption by CHIZO decreases with an increase in pH, and pseudo-second order kinetics control the reaction. The Langmuir isotherm was recognized to be the best fit model to describe the adsorption equilibrium with a significantly higher monolayer adsorption capacity of fluoride (31.35 mg g(-1)) than the host hydrous Fe-Zr oxide (8.21 mg g(-1)) at pH-7.0 and 303 K. The thermodynamically spontaneous nature of CHIZO is due to the exothermic nature of the reaction. In addition, phosphate and sulphate show an adverse effect on fluoride adsorption. beta-CD forms inclusion complexes by taking up fluoride ions from water into its central cavity and the driving forces associated with the complex formation include the release of enthalpy-rich water molecules from its cavity, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding and release of conformational strain. The poor regeneration of the spent adsorbent even in 1.0 M NaOH (below 20%) is probably a consequence of entrapping fluoride inside the cavity of beta-CD with hydrogen bonding. It has been found that only 0.9 g of CHIZO is able to reduce the fluoride level to below 1.0 mg L-1 in one-litre of fluoride spiked (5.0 mg L-1) natural water sample.

The electrochemical processes like hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been discussed closely on the effects of size, shape, exposed facets and surface area of electrocatalysts (metal oxides).","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Novel photolabile crosslinkers based on O-acyloxime moiety","Abstract":"Controlled decrosslinking is an attractive technique in the fields of functional materials and polymer recycling. Photo-triggered decrosslinking is especially advantageous for easy remote activation and spatiotemporal control. However, only a few photolabile units have been used for the cleavage in crosslinkers. Herein, 1,4-diacetylbenzene 1,4-bis(O-methacryloyl) dioxime and 1,3,5-triacetylbenzene 1,3,5-tris(O-methacryloyl)trioxime are proposed as novel crosslinkers. They have a benzene ring bearing two or three arms in which O-acyloxime moiety is introduced as a novel type of photolabile unit. These crosslinkers were prepared from aromatic ketones in two steps. Photopolymerization of methyl acrylate and the crosslinkers was performed using diphenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide as a photoinitiator and UV light above 310 nm. Obtained polymer films were crosslinked and insoluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF). These films were further irradiated at 254 nm of light. The photolysis of O-acyloxime units in these crosslinkers were confirmed by UV and IR spectral measurements. The precedence of decrosslinking on 254 nm irradiation was evidenced by the decrease in thickness of the films after soaking in THF. Soluble fraction of the decrosslinked polymers were subjected to size exclusion chromatography, and their molecular weights were found to be similar to that obtained by photopolymerized film in the absence of the crosslinker. These results demonstrated that the proposed compounds are potential candidates for novel photolabile crosslinkers.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Tunable design of layered CuCo2O4 nanosheets@MnO2 nanoflakes core shell arrays on Ni foam for high-performance supercapacitors","Abstract":"A facile and scalable method is developed to synthesize layered CuCo2O4 nanosheets@MnO2 nanoflakes core-shell arrays (CuCo2O4(aMnO(2) CAs) on Ni foam. Interestingly, the superstructures of the core include well-arranged micrometer length rectangular two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets with high pore volume. Subsequently, Mn02 nanoflakes are vertically grown on the CuCo2O4 nanosheets to form a core-shell architecture. The electrochemical measurements demonstrate a high specific capacitance of 416 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) with excellent rate capability and remarkable cycling stability (92.1% retention after 4200 cycles). Impressively, the optimized CuCo2O4(aMnO(2)\/\/AG ACS cell can be cycled reversibly in a wide voltage region as high as 2.0 V and exhibits a specific capacitance of 78 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g(-1) with a maximum energy density of 43.3 W h kg(-1). These encouraging results suggest that such a unique CuCo2O4(@MnO2 CAs architecture could be considered as one of the most promising candidates for energy storage devices with higher energy density delivery.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Nanofiber Formation by the Self-assembly of an Ampholyte Poly(amino acid)","Abstract":"Self-assembling nanofibers are produced by coiled-coil a single ampholyte poly(amino acid) using its intermolecular electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding.

Epand, Soft Matter, 2015, 11, DOI: 10.1039\/C4SM02819H","Abstract":"In the comment by Epand et al. on our recent article, it is stated that the term \"cholesterol solubility limit\" is misused. As Epand et al. point out, there is extensive literature on cholesterol phase separation in phospholipid bilayers and this term is used to define the appearance of cholesterol crystals. Moreover, as they state, this does not preclude them from existing as bilayered crystals or cholesterol-only domains within the membrane itself. Since our SANS data directly measured the maximum amount of cholesterol harboured by POPC and POPS membranes, it may have been more appropriate to use the term \"cholesterol saturation limit\". Nonetheless, we stated that the saturation and solubility limits of cholesterol coincide in both POPC and POPS. Epand and et al. suggest that the data shown was insufficient to uphold this claim. Herein, we present data that supports the coincidence of cholesterol's saturation limit with cholesterol's solubility limit in 100 nm POPS unilamellar vesicles, where previously it has been reported to not be the case.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Light- and Humidity-Induced Motion of an Acidochromic Film","Abstract":"A smart acidochromic agarose-based film with 1,4-bis(para-hydroxystyryl)benzene as the pH-responsive fluorophore was prepared. This film can simultaneously harness the chemical potential of light and aerial humidity gradients to convert them into mechanical work. The strong reversible hygroscopicity of the agarose matrix induces swift locomotion by mechanical deformation owing to exchange of water with the surroundings. Driven by humidity, a 20mg composite film coupled to a piezoelectric bending transducer sensor generates a peak output of approximately 80mV, which corresponds to a power density of 25Wkg(-1). Excitation with UV light triggers isomerization of the chromophore, which appears as reshaping by spiraling, bending, or twisting of the film. The material also responds to changes in the pHvalue by reversible protonation of the fluorophore with rapid changes in color and fluorescence. The threefold sensing capability of this smart material could be utilized for the fabrication of multiresponsive actuating dynamic elements in biomedicine and soft robotics.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Lipoprotein Nanoplatelets: Brightly Fluorescent, Zwitterionic Probes with Rapid Cellular Entry","Abstract":"Semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) are planar nanocrystals that have recently attracted considerable attention due to their quantum-well-like physics, atomically precise thickness, and unique photophysical properties such as narrow-band fluorescence emission. These attributes are of potential interest for applications in biomolecular and cellular imaging, but it has been challenging to colloidally stabilize these nanocrystals in biological media due to their large dimensions and tendency to aggregate. Here we introduce a new colloidal material that is a hybrid between a NPL and an organic nanodisc composed of phospholipids and lipoproteins. The phospholipids adsorb to flat surfaces on the NPL, and lipoproteins bind to sharp edges to enable monodisperse NPL encapsulation with long-term stability in biological buffers and high-salt solutions. The lipoprotein NPLs (L-NPLs) are highly fluorescent, with brightness comparable to that of wavelength-matched quantum dots at both the ensemble and single-molecule levels. They also exhibit a unique feature of rapid internalization into living cells, after which they retain their fluorescence. These unique properties suggest that L-NPLs are particularly well suited for applications in live-cell single-molecule imaging and multiplexed cellular labeling.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Reaction-induced swelling of ionic gels","Abstract":"A chemomechanical theory is proposed to describe the dynamic behavior and response time of ionic gels. The large deformation of these gels accompanied by the migration of mobile ions is driven by a common non-equilibrium chemical reaction.

In this study, to test whether TLR10 recognizes some known TLR ligands, we established a stable TLR10 knockdown human monocytic cell line THP-1 using TLR10 short hairpin RNA lentiviral particle and puromycin selection. Among 60 TLR10 knockdown clones that were derived from each single transduced cell, six clones were randomly selected, and then one of those clones, named E7, was chosen for the functional study. E7 exhibited approximately 50% inhibition of TLR10 mRNA and protein expression. Of all the TLRs, only the expression of TLR10 changed significantly in this cell line. Additionally, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced macrophage differentiation of TLR10 knockdown cells was not affected in the knockdown cells. When exposed to TLR ligands, such as synthetic diacylated lipoprotein (FSL-1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and flagellin, significant induction of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression including Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and Chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 20 (CCL20) expression, was found in the control THP-1 cells, whereas the TLR10 knockdown cells exhibited a significant reduction in the expression of IL-8, IL-1 beta, and CCL20. TNF-alpha was the only cytokine for which the expression did not decrease in the TLR10 knockdown cells from that measured in the control cells. Analysis of putative binding sites for transcription factors using a binding-site-prediction program revealed that the TNF-alpha promoter does not have putative binding sites for AP-1 or c-Jun, comprising a major transcription factor along with NF-kappa B for TLR signaling. Our results suggest that TLR10 is involved in the recognition of FSL-1, LPS, and flagellin and TLR-ligand-induced expression of TNF-alpha does not depend on TLR10.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"First developments of a new test to evaluate the fire behavior of photovoltaic modules on roofs","Abstract":"A new test for photovoltaic (PV) modules exposed to an external fire source on roofs is proposed, and first results are presented. This is a simplification of the standards commonly in use for testing PV modules as roofing parts, roofing components or building components. Most of the tests required different fire scenarios and the use of burning brands such as wood cribs. In our study we proposed replacing wooden burning brands with a propane burner, the output of which is close to the one that can be observed in the burning of wooden cribs 500 g and 2 kg in size. The fire behavior was assessed by measuring smoke evolution, burning drips, flaming debris, and the time to burn-through of monocrystalline, polycrystalline and amorphous silicon panels. Two different configurations of the burner were tested, with the fire source on the top of the module or under the tilted module, respectively. The fire behavior of the modules was dependent on the burner output (16 to 46 kW), but also on the construction type of the panel (glass\/glass or glass\/plastic sheet) and on the position of the fire source (top or bottom). These preliminary tests for further development of the procedure yielded encouraging results for the evaluation of PV panels on roofs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 ferrite nanofiber finally performed the excellent microwave absorption properties. The reflection loss was less than -10 dB in the whole X-band frequencies. The analysis of microwave absorption mechanism indicated that the microwave absorption bandwidth was mainly depended on the input impedance matching, the enhanced electromagnetic loss properties ensured that the entering wave could be mostly absorbed, and the frequency appearing the reflection loss peak was determined by the absorber thickness.

A semi-synthetic medium, supplemented with 0-5 mg\/L hormones, was used for the cultivations (at 32 degrees C for 48 h). By addition of 1 mg\/L of each hormone, the biomass and ethanol yields were increased and decreased, respectively. At higher levels, however, an inverse trend was observed. The glucosamine fraction of the cell wall, as a representative for chitosan, followed similar but sharper changes, compared to the biomass. The highest level was 221% higher than that obtained without hormones. The sum of glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine (chitin and chitosan) was noticeably enhanced in the presence of the hormones. Increase of chitosan was accompanied by a decrease in the phosphate content, with the lowest phosphate (0.01 g\/g cell wall) being obtained when the chitosan was at the maximum (0.45 g\/g cell wall). In conclusion, IAA and KIN significantly enhanced the M. indicus growth and chitosan production, while at the same time decreasing the ethanol yield to some extent. This study shows that plant growth hormones have a high potential for the improvement of fungal chitosan production by M. indicus.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Current Status and Future Prospects of Copper Oxide Heterojunction Solar Cells","Abstract":"The current state of thin film heterojunction solar cells based on cuprous oxide (Cu2O), cupric oxide (CuO) and copper (III) oxide (Cu4O3) is reviewed.

However, defects at the copper oxide heterojunction and film quality are still major constraining factors for achieving high power conversion efficiency, eta.

The health benefits are related to tannins' concentration that reaches the gastrointestinal tract (bioaccessible concentration) which could be affected by interaction with other biological molecules, such as salivary proteins (SP). Most of the work that studies tannin's health benefits does not consider these interactions. So, this work intended to mimic the ingestion of red wine condensed tannin fractions and assess the stability of the (in)soluble complexes formed between the different tannins and the different SP in a simulated stomach digestion. The results showed that some of the tannin\/SP complexes could be disrupted by gastric digestion leading to the release of tannins. This was observed for the complexes formed with the lowest polymerized tannins (monomers, dimers and trimers). Oppositely, the complexes formed by tannin tetramers and pentamers were significantly more resistant to stomach conditions. Therefore, SP probably influence negatively the concentrations at which tannins tetramers and pentamers reach the stomach and ultimately they may influence negatively some of these procyanidins biological potential health benefits. In the future, these and other biological interactions of tannin compounds should be taken into consideration in bioavailability and health benefits studies.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Plasmonic nanoparticle-semiconductor composites for efficient solar water splitting","Abstract":"Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising technology that uses light absorbing semiconductors to convert solar energy directly into a chemical fuel (i.e., hydrogen). PEC water splitting has the potential to become a key technology in achieving a sustainable society, if high solar to fuel energy conversion efficiencies are obtained with earth abundant materials. This review article discusses recent developments and discoveries in the mechanisms by which the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in metallic nanoparticles can increase or complement a neighbouring semiconductor in light absorption for catalytic water splitting applications. These mechanisms can mitigate the intrinsic optical limitations of semiconductors (e.g., metal oxides) for efficient solar water splitting. We identify four types of enhancement mechanisms in the recent literature: (i) light scattering, (ii) light concentration, (iii) hot electron injection (HEI), and (iv) plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET). (i) Light scattering and (ii) light concentration are light trapping mechanisms that can increase the absorption of light with energies above the semiconductor optical band-edge. These two mechanisms are ideal to enhance the absorption of promising semiconductors with narrow bandgap energies that suffer from limited absorption coefficients and bulk charge recombination. On the other hand, (iii) HEI and the recently discovered (iv) PIRET are mechanisms that can enhance the absorption also below the semiconductor optical band-edge. Therefore, HEI and PIRET have the potential to extend the light utilization to visible and near-infrared wavelengths of semiconductors with excellent electrochemical properties, but with large bandgap energies. New techniques and theories that have been developed to elucidate the above mentioned plasmonic mechanisms are presented and discussed for their application in metal oxide photoelectrodes. Finally, other plasmonic and non-plasmonic effects that do not increase the device absorption, but affect the electrochemical properties of the semiconductor (e.g., charge carrier transport) are also discussed, since a complete understanding of these phenomena is fundamental for the design of an efficient plasmonic NP-semiconductor water splitting device.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Electrochemical Study of Dopamine at Electrode Fabricated by Cellulose-Assisted Aqueous Dispersion of Long-Length Carbon Nanotube","Abstract":"A long-length (hundred micrometers) carbon nanotube is successfully dispersed in aqueous solution with surfactant cellulose while maintaining its length. An electrochemical study of the synthetic pathway of dopamine (DA), dopamine-o-quinone (DAQ), leucodopaminechrome (LDAC), and dopaminechrome (DAC) at the electrode fabricated by the long-length carbon nanotube dispersed solution is presented. The sequence DA reversible arrow DAQ -> LDAC reversible arrow DAC for the reaction is electron transfer-chemical reaction-electron transfer (ECE)-type, which is a chemical reaction (DAQ -> LDAC, C) interposed between two electron transfer reactions (DA reversible arrow DAQ and LDAC reversible arrow DAC, E). The salient electrochemical signals due to both DA reversible arrow DAQ and LDAC reversible arrow DAC can be obtained at the long-length carbon nanotube electrode, unlike other carbon electrodes such as carbon paste, graphene, fullerene, nanofiber, and graphite. The overall reaction is dominated by step DAQ -> LDAC and is sensitive to pH. With cyclic voltammetry in acidic media, the peak current due to LDAC -> DAC disappeared at a higher scan rate because the reaction rate for DAQ -> LDAC was so slow that DAQ was completely consumed in the electron transfer of DAQ -> DA before the chemical reaction of DAQ -> LDAC could go forward. In alkaline media, the peak height due to DAC -> LDAC became as high as that due to DA -> DAQ because the DAQ -> LDAC rate became fast enough that a sufficient amount of LDAC was generated for the subsequent reaction of LDAC -> DAC. Concomitantly, the reaction DAQ + LDAC reversible arrow DA + DAC was generated. Quantitative and selective detection of dopamine based on the signal due to LDAC -> DAC is possible just as in the conventional strategy of direct oxidation of dopamine (DA -> DAQ).","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"State of the art Ag50-xSbxSe50-yTey alloys: Their high zT values, microstructures and related phase equilibria","Abstract":"Turning waste heat into electricity using thermoelectric materials supports the crucial goals of the sustainable development.

It is remarkable that a binary compound exhibits strong anharmonic and anisotropic bonding, and after hole doping it shows an exceptionally high power factor because of a high electrical conductivity and a strongly enhanced Seebeck coefficient.

Results showed that the composite separator had a uniform surface morphology and highly gradient three-dimensional porous structure, which led to a low electrolyte contact angle of 35 degrees and an area electrical resistance of 0.08 Omega cm(2). Moreover, it showed a low weight reduction rate of 7.5% and an area shrinkage rate of 2.0% in 40 wt% KOH solution at 333 K for 120 h. Due to the electrolyte-philic macroporous layer, the composite separator exhibited a high electrolyte-absorbing rate, which was higher than 55 mm for 5 min. These characteristics endowed the composite separator with excellent electrochemical performance, including a short activation time and a long dry\/wet storage life. It is demonstrated that the composite separator can be a good candidate for alkaline batteries, especially for self-activated zinc-silver oxide batteries.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"State of the art of nanoforest structures and their applications","Abstract":"Forest-like nanostructures, their syntheses, properties, and applications are reviewed. Nanoforests are mainly represented by carbon nanotubes, zinc and titanium oxides, and gold, and much less frequently by other metals, metal oxides, arsenides and phosphides. These nanostructures generally consist of more simple 1D objects, such as nanowires, nanopillars, nanorods, nanotrees, nanofibers or nanotubes. Synthesis methods for nanoforests vary from catalytic pyrolysis or thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons to electrophoretic deposition, hydrothermal routes, electron beam lithography, focused-ion-beam techniques, vapor phase transport, facet-selective etching and pulsed deep reactive etching technologies, among others. A number of applications for the forest-like nanostructures are generalized, for instance as sensors\/detectors, photoanodes in solar and fuel cells, supercapacitors and energy storage devices, in SERS applications, optical and MEMs switching devices, water splitting processes, CO2 fixation, and as supports or targets for biomolecules. In general, it is expected that more varieties of compounds and materials with exciting properties can be obtained in this form in the near future, thus expanding numerous applications of forest-like nanostructures.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Solar photocatalytic degradation of sulfanilamide by BiOCl\/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites: Mechanism and degradation pathways","Abstract":"Flower-like bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) catalysts were synthesized with a facile hydrolysis reaction, where the synthesized BiOCl products were further decorated with the prepared graphene oxide (GO) to form novel BiOCl\/reduced graphene oxide (BiOCl\/RGO) composites. The as-synthesized materials were well characterized with the aid of various techniques, before they were used as photocatalysts for the degradation of sulfanilamide (SN) aqueous solution. The BiOCl\/RGO composites contained 1 wt% RGO exhibited superior photocatalytic response, where the degradation rate of SN at 82.7% stayed 30% higher than that of pure BiOCl. The enhanced photocatalytic performances of BiOCl\/RGO composites were neither related to the surface area values nor the bandgap of the fabricated photocatalysts, but associated with the enhanced visible light absorption and advanced electron transfer ability. On a basis of the analysis on the SN intermediate products by HPLC, IC, FTIR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and MS, the degradation pathway of SN was speculated, where it was confirmed that the main intermediate product of SN was sulfanilic acid.

In recent years, research supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Fuel Cell Technologies Office has contributed substantially to the development of these technologies. Enhanced performance and reduced cost in automotive fuel cells are important examples of achievement. The research investments are clearly paying off, as commercial fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are being rolled out by major car manufacturers today. With increasing market penetration of FCEVs, enabling technologies for the affordable and widespread production, storage and delivery of renewable hydrogen are becoming increasingly important. Long term commercial viability of hydrogen and fuel cells in the commercial marketplace will rely on continued materials research on several important fronts. Examples include the discovery and development of: (1) non-platinum-group-metal catalysts for next-generation fuel cells; (2) durable, high-performance photocatalytic materials systems for direct solar water splitting; (3) advanced materials-based systems for low-pressure, high-volumetric-density hydrogen storage; and (4) low-cost, hydrogen-compatible pipeline materials for hydrogen delivery and distribution. Research innovations in macro-, meso- and nano-scale materials are all needed for pushing forward the state-of-the-art in these areas. New approaches in accelerated materials development facilitated by a national Energy Materials Network of advanced scientific resources in theory, computation and experimentation are being adopted at DOE. Application of these approaches to address the key materials challenges in hydrogen and fuel cell technologies are discussed.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Substoichiometric Hydroxynonenylation of a Single Protein Recapitulates Whole-Cell-Stimulated Antioxidant Response","Abstract":"Lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs) that can directly modify proteins have emerged as important small-molecule cues in cellular decision-making. However, because these diffusible LDEs can modify many targets [e.g., >700 cysteines are modified by the well-known LDE 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)], establishing the functional consequences of LDE modification on individual targets remains devilishly difficult. Whether LDE modifications on a single protein are biologically sufficient to activate discrete redox signaling response downstream also remains untested. Herein, using T-REX (targetable reactive electrophiles and oxidants), an approach aimed at selectively flipping a single redox switch in cells at a precise time, we show that a modest level (similar to 34%) of HNEylation on a single target is sufficient to elicit the pharmaceutically important antioxidant response element (ARE) activation, and the resultant strength of ARE induction recapitulates that observed from whole-cell electrophilic perturbation. These data provide the first evidence that single-target LDE modifications are important individual events in mammalian physiology.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Effect of aggregation behavior and phenolic hydroxyl group content on the performance of lignosulfonate doped PEDOT as a hole extraction layer in polymer solar cells","Abstract":"Using lignosulfonate (LS) and alkyl chain-coupled lignosulfonate-based polymer (ALS) as the raw materials, the aggregation behavior of LS and ALS was investigated, and they both showed a unique aggregation behavior to form a block-like self-assembly for the first time. The aggregation behavior and mechanism of LS and ALS were investigated by SEM, TEM and DLS. The block-like aggregates prepared from ALS (micron size) were larger than that of LS (nano size). The unique aggregates were also further confirmed by XPS, meanwhile, SAXS was applied to explore the regular intrinsic characteristics of the block-like aggregates. Inspired by the aggregation behavior of LS and ALS, the electron transfer properties of LS and ALS were also studied including the electrochemical properties and hole mobility measurements. The oxidation peaks at 1.2 V and 1.4 V were observed at the LS and ALS modified electrode, respectively. We studied the hole transport properties of LS and ALS using the space-charge-limited current method (SCLC). Average hole mobilities of 2.95 x 10(-6) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 3.18 x 10(-7) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) were estimated for LS and ALS, respectively. The above results indicated that LS and ALS are potential water soluble polymeric p-type semiconductors, and the hole transport property of LS is better than that of ALS. Based on the unique aggregation behavior and hole mobility property described above which will facilitate charge transport, water soluble PEDOT:LS and PEDOT:ALS were prepared and applied as the hole extraction layer (HEL) in polymer solar cells. The PCE decreased with a decrease of the phenolic hydroxyl group content (-OH), which suggested that -OH is important for the strength of the PCE. The application properties were consistent with the results of the aggregation behavior and electron transfer properties. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.19% from PEDOT: LS-1 : 1 as the HTL was achieved with a device structure of ITO\/HEL\/PTB7:PC71BM\/Al in our study. Our results showed that the phenolic hydroxyl group content and conjugation structure of amorphous LS contribute to its promising potential as a dopant of semiconductors, such as PEDOT in organic electronics. Our results provide a novel perspective for the design of dopants for semiconductive polymers. In summary, the phenolic hydroxyl group of the polymer will provide hole transport capability due to its oxidation during device operation.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"A facile method for preparation of self-healing epoxy composites: using electrospun nanofibers as microchannels","Abstract":"Electrospun nanofibrous mats of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) carrying epoxy and amine dual healing solutions were incorporated into an epoxy matrix to impart self-healing functionality.

Silica nanocasting and KOH activation are amenable to porosity introduction and therefore remain the most crucial pathways for porous carbon synthesis. However, these methods are multistep and rather energy-intensive processes. In the present work, a series of hierarchical porous carbon monoliths were prepared from fructose by a one-step ionothermal carbonization approach using an iron-based ionic liquid as solvent, and a porogenic agent. Importantly, the prepared carbon materials show narrow bi-modal pore distributions and possess super-high surface areas of ca. 1200 m(2) g(-1), which is the highest value in hydrothermal carbons as far as we know. The morphology of the monolithic carbons consists of interconnected carbon particles with fairly small particle sizes of ca. 30-50 nm. Moreover, the spent ionic liquids could be easily recovered by Soxhlet extraction, at above 98% for the cycle of ionothermal carbonization. Owing to their favorable textural properties, the impact of the porosity of the ionothermal carbons on their electrochemical capacitive performance was investigated. The ionothermal carbons exhibit a high specific capacitance of 245 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). The promising capacitive performance could be attributed to the high surface areas and well-controlled micro-and mesoporosities of the carbons. In addition, the hierarchical porosity and high surface area of the carbon lend it to highly efficient adsorption of methyl orange (q(e) = 240 mg g(-1)) and malachite green (q(e) = 170 mg g(-1)) from wastewater.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Hard Carbon Originated from Polyvinyl Chloride Nanofibers As High-Performance Anode Material for Na-Ion Battery","Abstract":"Two types of hard carbon materials were synthesized through direct pyrolysis of commercial polyvinyl chloride (PVC) particles and pyrolysis of PVC nanofibers at 600-800 degrees C, respectively, where the nanofibers were prepared by an electrospinning PVC precursors method.

The hard carbon obtained from PVC nanofibers achieved a high reversible capacity of 271 mAh\/g and an initial Coulombic efficiency of 69.9%, which were much superior to the one from commercial PVC, namely, a reversible capacity of 206 mAh\/g and an initial Coulombic efficiency of 60.9%.

The microstructure of the AF\/aerogels showed that the aramid fibers were inlaid in the aerogel matrix acting as the supporting skeleton, which established the foundation of mechanical properties. Three point bending indicated that improvement in flexibility could be achieved by similar to 5% fiber content without compromising the thermal insulation properties. As the fiber content increased, the density monotonously decreased to 0.142 g.cm(-3) while the thermal conductivity increased slightly with ranging between 0.0221-0.0235 W.m(-1).K-1. The hot plate experiments indicated the transient thermal transfer Was similar to one-dimensional heat transfer and the heat transfer characteristics were further analyzed in which a simple method to estimate the thermal conductivity was established according to the Fourier's law. TG-DSC analysis revealed that the thermal stability was up to approximately 285 degrees C which was mainly depended on the thermostability of pure silica aerogels.

It was found that the emission of PCC in the nanofiber-based film could be quenched significantly upon exposure to gaseous TFA due to the formation of protonated PCC, in which ICT (intramolecular charge transfer) would occur. On the other hand, TFA vapor led to the emitting colors of PDC and PSC in the nanofiber-based films to turn to yellow and green from sky blue and blue, respectively. Additionally, we found that the decay times of PCC were 0.1s and 1.9s in probing the saturated vapor of TFA in nanofiber-based film and in spin-coated film, respectively.

Metabolomic profiling for the different bio-samples was analyzed by using Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-Orbitrap-MS). Behavioral tests were applied to evaluate the depressive degree and antidepressive effect. Then univariate and multivariate statistics including Student's t-test, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were applied to reveal the metabolic differences between the control, model and antidepressive-treated groups. Metabolomics analysis demonstrated that MDD was a kind of systemic disease in which disturbance of neuroendocrinology, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism and synthesis of neurotransmitters were involved. The significantly changed metabolites acquired from the statistical method were identified and a simplified panel which consisted of 6 metabolites including L-tryptophan, L-kynurenine, quinolinic acid, L-phenylalanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid and N-acetylaspartic acid was obtained. In combination with the results of the sucrose preference test, a new PLS-DA model conducted by the identified changed metabolome showed a good predictive power which meant the metabolome was able to rank the depressive level as the behavioral test. Then correlational analysis indicated the simplified panel in plasma had a relative good correlation with that in hippocampus and PFC. This study offers a new strategy for characterization of endogenous metabolic perturbations by a metabolomics method and the good predictive power and correlation for the significantly changed metabolome between plasma and brain regions which might be helpful in ranking the depressive level in the CUMS model. These results are helpful in the further study to develop a noninvasive and exact diagnostic approach by an objective laboratory-based test through the metabolomics platform.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Free Radical Scavenging and Cellular Antioxidant Properties of Astaxanthin","Abstract":"Astaxanthin is a coloring agent which is used as a feed additive in aquaculture nutrition. Recently, potential health benefits of astaxanthin have been discussed which may be partly related to its free radical scavenging and antioxidant properties. Our electron spin resonance (ESR) and spin trapping data suggest that synthetic astaxanthin is a potent free radical scavenger in terms of diphenylpicryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and galvinoxyl free radicals. Furthermore, astaxanthin dose-dependently quenched singlet oxygen as determined by photon counting. In addition to free radical scavenging and singlet oxygen quenching properties, astaxanthin induced the antioxidant enzyme paroxoanase-1, enhanced glutathione concentrations and prevented lipid peroxidation in cultured hepatocytes. Present results suggest that, beyond its coloring properties, synthetic astaxanthin exhibits free radical scavenging, singlet oxygen quenching, and antioxidant activities which could probably positively affect animal and human health.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Catalase-Modified Carbon Electrodes: Persuading Oxygen To Accept Four Electrons Rather Than Two","Abstract":"We successfully exploited the natural highly efficient activity of an enzyme (catalase) together with carbon electrodes to produce a hybrid electrode for oxygen reduction, very appropriate for energy transformation. Carbon electrodes, in principle, are cheap but poor oxygen reduction materials, because only two-electron reduction of oxygen occurs at low potentials, whereas four-electron reduction is key for energy-transformation technology. With the immobilization of catalase on the surface, the hydrogen peroxide produced electrochemically is decomposed back to oxygen by the enzyme; the enzyme natural activity on the surface regenerates oxygen, which is further reduced by the carbon electrode with no direct electron transfer between the enzyme and the electrode. Near full four-electron reduction of oxygen is realised on a carbon electrode, which is modified with ease by a commercially available enzyme. The value of such enzyme-modified electrode for energy-transformation devices is evident.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Tensile actuators of carbon nanotube coiled yarn based on polydiacetylene-pluronic copolymers as temperature indicators","Abstract":"Most polydiacetylenes (PDAs) have been studied as chromatic sensors or temperature indicators because of their phase transition that is accompanied by a color change from blue to red. Here, we focus on the structural change based on the polydiacetylene phase transition for a temperature-responsive tensile actuator at low temperature using a copolymer composed of PDA and pluronic in a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) coiled yarn. In this paper, we do not focus on the general color change phenomenon of PDA. We demonstrate that the volume change of PDA in the MWCNT coiled yarn provides similar to 180% tensile strain at low temperature (similar to 53 degrees C). Insertion of the pluronic copolymer into the coiled yarn composed of PDA and MWCNT caused the tensile actuation temperature to decrease by similar to 6 degrees C (with tensile actuation of similar to 230%) compared to an actuator without pluronic copolymer. Furthermore, we could verify that the large tensile actuation was also predominantly affected by the melting of the nonpolymerized diacetylene (DA) monomer and the pluronic copolymer. MWCNT coiled yarn actuators with PDA-pluronic copolymer can be easily prepared, have a large tensile actuation, and are actuated at low temperature.

Most currently-used phosphors depend on strategically important rare earth elements, and rely on a multicomponent approach, which produces sub-optimal quality white light. Here, we report the design and preparation of a colloidal white-light emitting nanocrystal conjugate. This conjugate is obtained by linking colloidal Ga2O3 and II-VI nanocrystals in the solution phase with a short bifunctional organic molecule (thioglycolic acid). The two types of nanocrystals are electronically coupled by Forster resonance energy transfer owing to the short separation between Ga2O3 (energy donor) and core\/shell CdSe\/CdS (energy acceptor) nanocrystals, and the spectral overlap between the photoluminescence of the donor and the absorption of the acceptor. Using steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopies, we quantified the contribution of the energy transfer to the photoluminescence spectral power distribution and the corresponding chromaticity of this nanocrystal conjugate. Quantitative understanding of this new system allows for tuning of the emission color and the design of quasi-single white light emitting inorganic phosphors without the use of rare-earth elements.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"On-Demand Guided Bone Regeneration with Microbial Protection of Ornamented SPU Scaffold with Bismuth-Doped Single Crystalline Hydroxyapatite: Augmentation and Cartilage Formation","Abstract":"Guided bone regeneration (GBR) scaffolds are futile in many clinical applications due to infection problems.

Bi-nHA with high aspect ratio was prepared without any templates. Subsequently, it was introduced into an unprecedented synthesized SPU matrix based on dual soft segments (PCL-b-PDMS) of poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), by an in situ technique followed by electrospinning to fabricate scaffolds. For comparison, undoped pristine nHA rods were also ornamented into it. The enzymatic ring-opening polymerization technique was adapted to synthesize soft segments of PCL-b-PDMS copolymers of SPU. Structure elucidation of the synthesized polymers is done by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Sparingly, Bi-nHA ornamented scaffolds exhibit tremendous improvement (155%) in the mechanical properties with excellent antimicrobial activity against various human pathogens. After confirmation of high osteoconductivity, improved biodegradation, and excellent biocompatibility against osteoblast cells (in vitro), the scaffolds were implanted in rabbits by subcutaneous and intraosseous (tibial) sites. Various histological sections reveal the signatures of early cartilage formation, endochondral ossification, and rapid bone healing at 4 weeks of the critical defects filled with ornamented scaffold compared to SPU scaffold. This implies osteogenic potential and ability to provide an adequate biomimetic microenvironment for mineralization for GBR of the scaffolds. Organ toxicity studies further confirm that no tissue architecture abnormalities were observed in hepatic, cardiac, and renal tissue sections.

These compositions use powdered boron carbide (B4C) as a pyrotechnic fuel, KNO3 as a pyrotechnic oxidizer, and KCl as a combustion temperature moderator. Small amounts of calcium stearate and polymeric binders may be added to moderate burning rate and for composition granulation. Prototype tests involving three preferred compositions were conducted in end- and core-burning grenade and canister configurations. Smoke release times ranged from 3.5 to 70 s for the grenades and from 8 to 100 s for the canisters. Notably, any desired smoke release time within these ranges may be obtained by fine adjustment to the calcium stearate content of the compositions and\/or small changes to the device containers. Aerosolization efficiency and quantitative performance, as determined by smoke chamber measurements, remain consistent regardless of smoke release time. Impact, friction, and electrostatic discharge tests show that the compositions are insensitive to accidental ignition and are safe to handle.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Controlling the resolution and duration of pulsatile release from injectable magnetic 'plum-pudding' nanocomposite hydrogels","Abstract":"Manipulation of the relative swelling and volume fractions of the microgel and bulk hydrogel phases of nanocomposite hydrogels containing superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) is demonstrated to enable higher on-off state resolution and enhanced total duration of pulsatile drug release potential when the nanocomposites are activated by an alternating magnetic field. Adjusting the microgel chemistry to create microgels that have less deswelling below 37 degrees C and more proportional deswelling between 37 degrees C and 43 degrees C, increasing the volume fraction of microgels in the nanocomposite (while maintaining the mechanical stability of the nanocomposite), and limiting the swelling capacity of the surrounding hydrogel were all found to improve the degree of enhanced release that occurs after an externally-operated AMF pulse. Collectively, these results serve both to optimize the function of these nanocomposite materials for pulsatile drug delivery as well as confirm the proposed mechanism of pulsatile release, by which free volume is generated within the nanocomposite at the thermoresponsive microgel-bulk hydrogel interface upon internal heating of the device via SPION-driven hysteresis heating of the nanocomposite in an alternating magnetic field. Coupled with the injectability, degradability, mechanical stability, and cytocompatibility of these nanocomposites, we anticipate potential applications as advanced 'smart' drug delivery technologies that can be operated via an external and non-invasive trigger.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Plasma Surface Functionalized Polyetheretherketone for Enhanced Osseo-Integration at Bone-Implant Interface","Abstract":"This study aims at improving osseo-integration at the bone-implant interface of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) by water (H2O) and ammonia (NH3) plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). The pertinent surface characteristics including surface energy, roughness, morphology, and chemical composition are investigated systematically and the in vitro biological performance is evaluated by cell adhesion and proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, real-time RT-PCR evaluation, and mineralization tests. In vivo osseo-integration is examined via implanting samples into the distal femur of the rats. The hydrophilicity, surface roughness, cell adhesion, and proliferation, ALP activity, and osteogenic differentiation after H2O PIII or NH3 PIII are improved significantly. Furthermore, substantially enhanced osseo-integration is achieved in vivo. Nonline-of-sight plasma surface functionalization, which is particularly suitable for biomedical implants with an irregular geometry, does not alter the bulk compressive yield strength and elastic modulus of the materials. Consequently, the favorable bulk attributes of PEEK are preserved while the surface biological properties are enhanced thus boding well for wider orthopedic application of the biopolymer.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Thermally flexible epoxy\/cellulose blends mediated by an ionic liquid","Abstract":"Blends between the widely used thermoset resin, epoxy, and the most abundant organic material, natural cellulose are demonstrated for the first time.

Direct filament writing of different nanocomposite hydrogels in patterns, and subsequent healing of the filaments into continuous films while drying leads to a variety of linear, parabolic and striped bulk gradients.

The result showed that at six and 16 weeks of age, the LPS-treated offspring exhibited increased collagen synthesis, an elevated cardiac index (CI), higher mRNA levels of TIMP-2 and TGF and a reduced mRNA level of MMP2. The protein levels corresponded to the mRNA levels. The offspring that were prenatally treated with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid (PDTC), an inhibitor of NF-B, displayed improvements in the CI and in collagen synthesis.

Three different supports (mesoporous carbon (STC), porous carbon (TC), and microporous carbon (DC)) were prepared; 5 wt% Pt on commercial activated carbon (Pt\/C) was also used as a comparison. The surface characterizations of the catalysts were examined by FE-SEM, BET, XRD, XPS and HR-TEM. The Pt\/C and Pt\/STC proved to be superior catalysts for producing high yields of lignin-oil (Pt\/C: 79.9 wt% and Pt\/STC: 79.4 wt%) with low amounts of char (Pt\/C: 4.2 wt% and Pt\/STC: 7.6 wt%) compared to the other catalysts. This is due to the fine dispersion of Pt (i.e., higher BET surface area) on these carbon supports. In addition, we found a high correlation between the BET surface area (Pt dispersion) and the molecular weight of the lignin-oil. The amounts of monomeric phenol compounds, which are mainly composed of 4-ethlyphenol, 4-methylguaiacol, and 4-propylguaiacol, were also higher with Pt\/C (90.92 mg g(-1) of lignin) and Pt\/STC (78.06 mg g(-1) of lignin) compared to the other samples.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acids immobilised on cellulose paper as a DNA sensor","Abstract":"A new label-free DNA sensor based on pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid on cellulose paper was fabricated.

In this work, we set up a theoretical model to explore the wrapping effect of a substrate-supported membrane on CNTs, taking the deformation of CNTs into consideration. Our results show that the competition between the membrane bending stiffness and the CNT-membrane adhesion strength induces a double-edged effect on the stability of a single CNT wrapped by a substrate-supported membrane, that is, the membrane can facilitate the laying down and collapse of the CNT due to its bending rigidity, while it tends to maintain the upright and open shape of the CNT as a result of the CNT-membrane adhesion. The phase boundary for the open and collapsed configurations due to this competition can be well described by a simple analytical model. Furthermore, the competition can also result in the transition of the membrane between adhering to and detaching from the substrate in the system of two widely spaced CNTs covered by a substrate-supported cell membrane, which is consistent with experimental observations.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Cycloadditions for Studying Nucleic Acids","Abstract":"Cycloaddition reactions for site-specific or global modification of nucleic acids have enabled the preparation of a plethora of previously inaccessible DNA and RNA constructs for structural and functional studies on naturally occurring nucleic acids, the assembly of nucleic acid nanostructures, therapeutic applications, and recently, the development of novel aptamers.

Functionalization of graphene and few-layer-graphene flakes with Fe3O4 nanopartides allowed us to align the fillers in an external magnetic field during dispersion-of the thermal paste to the connecting surfaces. The filler alignment results in a strong increase of the apparent thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity through the layer of nano-composite inserted between two metallic surfaces. The self-aligning \"magnetic graphene\" fillers improve heat conduction in composites with both curing and non-curing matrix materials. The thermal conductivity enhancement with the oriented fillers is a factor of two larger than that with the random fillers even at the low similar to 1 wt.% of graphene loading. The real-life testing with computer chips demonstrated the temperature rise decrease by as muchas 10 degrees C with use of the non-curing thermal interface material with similar to 1 wt.% of the oriented fillers. Our proof-of-concept experiments suggest that the thermal interface materials with functionalized graphene and few-layer-graphene fillers, which can be oriented during the composite application to the surfaces, can lead to a new method of thermal management of advanced electronics.

Using spectrophotometry technique a catalytic activity of these systems was' studied on the example of hydrolysis reaction of O-p-nitrophenyl-O-alkylchloromethylphosphonates (alkyl -, ethyl (P1) and n-hexyl (P2)). At the first step the catalytic effect of individual solutions of pyrimidinophanes was examined. Pronounced substrate specificity far two different phosphonates was revealed: inhibition of hydrolysis for phosphonate with ethyl residue and catalysis of kydrolysis for phosphonate with n-hexvl moiety Similar unusual effect jar organized systems based on cationic surfactants could he a result of the influence of two opposite factors. On the one hand, pH decrease with the pyrimidinophane concentration was found. It corresponds to reducing of OFT ions concentration in reaction medium and, there\/are inhibition of hydrolysis occurs. On the other hand, aggregation in aqueous solutions' of pyrimidinophane induces reactant concentrating in surfactant\" aggregates that accelerates the reaction. Thereby depending on the domination of the first or the second jactor inhibition or catalysis may he observed. Experimental kinetic data allow us' to assume that phosphonate P2 because of its higher hydrophobicity and affinity to nonpolar core of micellar pseudophase possesses the higher capability to binding with pyrimidinophane aggregates in comparison with P1 Quantitative treatment of obtained kinetic data in terms of pseudophase model has revealed that binding ability of P2 with pyrimidinophane aggregates' is almost 2 times' greater than in the case of P1. Moreover hydrolysis in catalytic complex proceeds' more than 5 times faster for substrate with n-hexyl residue. This fact is also due to the high capability of P2 to concentrate within hydrophobic' core of primidinopharie aggregates. Thus it can be concluded that in the case of P2 the domination of positive contribution over the negative contribution of pH decrease with,surfactant concentration is' achieved due to high capability of substrate to bind with pyrimidinophane aggregates' and high rate of hydrolysis in catalytic complex. It results in catalysis of reaction. At the same time, moderate ability of P1 to hind with aggregates is not enough to compensate pH decrease, which results in inhibition of reaction. Upon the transitionII-0m individual solutions' of pyrimidinophane to its' binary mixture with polvethyleneimine the difference of kinetic' constants between PI and P2 tends to he preserved. However absolute values' of these constants are much lower than in the case of individual solutions' of pyrimidinophane. Probably, it is due to the fact that cooperative aggregation between surfactant and polymer prevents reactant concentration in surfactant\/polymer aggregates. However, resulting catalytic' effect of binary,system for both phosphonates is' higher than in the case of individual solutions of pyrimidinophane. It is due to high contribution of general basic' catalysis to summary effect with the participation OF amino groups' of PEI thereby levelling pH decrease. Addition of La3+ ions to the surfactant\/polymer system allows of inverting catalytic activity from inhibition to catalysis accompanied by significant increase in kinetic' constants far P1. Obviously it is' due to electrophylic catalysis which involves' La3+ ion coordination near oxygen atom of phospliwyl group. In the case of P2 expected increase in maximum of catalytic activity does' not occur. Decrease in OTT-ions concentration during the formation of lanthanum hydroxocomplexes [La(OH)](2+) and [La(OH)(2)](+) due to salt hydrolysis could he the possible reason of this phenomenon. Thereby in the framework of this study supramolecular catalysts for cleavage of organophosphorous substrates were designed on the basis of novel amphiphilic tetracationic pyrimidinophane. Catalytic activity of the system could he controlled by addition ofpolvmer and lanthanum salt Results' obtained could have practical relevance in terms. of creation of effective agents for utilization of natural ecotaxicants.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Improved electrochemical performance of lithium iron phosphate in situ coated with hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped graphene-like membrane","Abstract":"LiFePO4 in situ coated with hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped graphene-like membrane (HPNGM) composite derived from a electrospun polymer membrane (EPM) precursor has been achieved for the first time.

Subsequent calcination and fragmentation by ultrasonic vibration rendered short nanofibers with 10-40 nm diameters and tens to hundreds nm lengths. Slurry containing SSC nanofibers was screen-printed on CGO (Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95) disks to prepare SSC\/CGO\/SSC symmetrical cells. Similar symmetrical cells were also prepared using SSC powder derived from the glycine-nitrate combustion method for comparison. AC impedance measurement of the symmetrical cells under open circuit condition revealed that the electrolyte\/nanofiber-electrode interfacial area specific resistances (ASR) were 0.533, 0.187, 0.061, 0.026 and 0.010 Omega cm(2) at 500, 550, 600, 650 and 700 degrees C, respectively. These values were several to more than ten times smaller than the corresponding values of the powder cathodes. The large surface area of the nanofibers provide a large number of reaction sites for oxygen reduction and hence low ASRs. A NiO-CGO\/CGO\/SSC (nanofiber) single cell was also prepared and tested using humidified H-2 as fuel and air as oxidant, the peak power output at 700 degrees C is 1.09 W cm(-2).

Electrospinning has been identified as a straight forward and viable technique to produce nanofibers from polymer solution as their initial precursor. These nanofiber materials have attracted attention of researchers due to their enhanced and exceptional nanostructural characteristics. Electrospun polyaniline (PANI) based nanofiber is one of the important new materials for the rapidly growing technology development such as nanofiber based sensor devices, conductive tissue engineering scaffold materials, supercapacitors, and flexible solar cells applications. PANI however is relatively hard to process compared to that of other conventional polymers and plastics. The processing of PANI is daunting, mainly due to its rigid backbone which is related to its high level of conjugation. The challenges faced in the electrospinning processing of neat PANI have alternatively led to the development of the electrospun PANI based composites and blends.

In this treatment hydroxyl radicals are formed due to the reaction of the iron catalyst along with in situ electrogenerated H2O2. However, one of the main limitations of this system is the iron released in the treated effluent. Therefore, retention of iron is required, and in this study, the use of a new cathode in which the iron is fixed on nickel foam is proposed as a solution to the electro-Fenton treatment in continuous processes. RESULTS: The retention of iron was ensured by its fixation on nickel foam using chitosan, an eco-friendly polymer, as coating agent. Different chitosan coatings were tested to optimize the manufacturing process of the new cathode. It was concluded that the best electrode for the electro-Fenton treatment of different dyes (Poly R-478 and Lissamine Green B) was obtained using a half-coating electrode cover with iron-chitosan of medium molecular weight. Furthermore, its reusability was positively evaluated in successive cycles. Finally, a continuous treatment using a fluidized bed reactor was successfully performed for the treatment of dye Lissamine Green B.

Based on the investigation of physical and chemical mechanisms, we focus on its materials, device structures, and treatment methods so as to provide an in-depth perspective of state-of-the-art oxide-based RRAM. The critical voltage and constant reaction energy properties were found, which can be used to prospectively modulate voltage and operation time to control RRAM device working performance and forecast material composition. The quantized switching phenomena in RRAM devices were demonstrated at ultra-cryogenic temperature (4K), which is attributed to the atomic-level reaction in metallic filament. In the aspect of chemical mechanisms, we use the Coulomb Faraday theorem to investigate the chemical reaction equations of RRAM for the first time. We can clearly observe that the first-order reaction series is the basis for chemical reaction during reset process in the study. Furthermore, the activation energy of chemical reactions can be extracted by changing temperature during the reset process, from which the oxygen ion reaction process can be found in the RRAM device. As for its materials, silicon oxide is compatible to semiconductor fabrication lines. It is especially promising for the silicon oxide-doped metal technology to be introduced into the industry. Based on that, double-ended graphene oxide-doped silicon oxide based via-structure RRAM with filament self-aligning formation, and self-current limiting operation ability is demonstrated. The outstanding device characteristics are attributed to the oxidation and reduction of graphene oxide flakes formed during the sputter process. Besides, we have also adopted a new concept of supercritical CO2 fluid treatment to efficiently reduce the operation current of RRAM devices for portable electronic applications.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Clean Synthesis of an Economical 3D Nanochain Network of PdCu Alloy with Enhanced Electrocatalytic Performance towards Ethanol Oxidation","Abstract":"A one-pot method for the fast synthesis of a 3D nanochain network (NNC) of PdCu alloy without any surfactants is described. The composition of the as-prepared PdCu alloy catalysts can be precisely controlled by changing the precursor ratio of Pd to Cu. First, the Cu content changes the electronic structure of Pd in the 3D NNC of PdCu alloy. Second, the 3D network structure offers large open pores, high surface areas, and self-supported properties. Third, the surfactant-free strategy results in a relatively clean surface. These factors all contribute to better electrocatalytic activity and durability towards ethanol oxidation. Moreover, the use of copper in the alloy lowers the price of the catalyst by replacing the noble metal palladium with non-noble metal copper. The composition-optimized Pd80Cu20 alloy in the 3D NNC catalyst shows an increased electrochemically active surface area (80.95 m(2)g(-1)) and a 3.62-fold enhancement of mass activity (6.16 Amg(-1)) over a commercial Pd\/C catalyst.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Can natural fibers be a silver bullet?

The CM stems from the charge interactions between the substrate and molecules. Despite the extensive studies of the energy alignment between 2D materials and molecules, an understanding of how the electronic properties of the substrate are explicitly involved in the charge interaction is still unclear. Lately, a new group of 2D layered materials with anisotropic structures, including orthorhombic black phosphorus (BP) and triclinic rhenium disulfide (ReS2), has attracted great interest due to their unique anisotropic electrical and optical properties. Herein, we report a unique anisotropic Raman enhancement on few-layered BP and ReS2 using copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) molecules as a Raman probe, which is absent on isotropic graphene and h-BN. According to detailed Raman tensor analysis and density functional theory calculations, anisotropic charge interactions between the 2D materials and molecules are responsible for the angular dependence of the Raman enhancement. Our findings not only provide new insights into the CM process in SERS, but also open up new avenues for the exploration and application of the electronic properties of anisotropic 2D layered materials.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Sliding droplets of Xanthan solutions: A joint experimental and numerical study","Abstract":"We have investigated the sliding of droplets made of solutions of Xanthan, a stiff rodlike polysaccharide exhibiting a non-Newtonian behavior, notably characterized by a shear thinning viscosity accompanied by the emergence of normal stress difference as the polymer concentration is increased. These experimental results are quantitatively compared with those of Newtonian fluids (water). The impact of the non-Newtonian behavior on the sliding process was shown through the relation between the average dimensionless velocity (i.e. the capillary number) and the dimensionless volume forces (i.e. the Bond number). To this aim, it is needed to define operative strategies to compute the capillary number for the shear thinning fluids and compare with the corresponding Newtonian case. The resulting capillary number for the Xanthan solutions scales linearly with the Bond number at small inclinations, as well known for Newtonian fluids, while it shows a plateau as the Bond number is increased. Experimental data were complemented with lattice Boltzmann numerical simulations of sliding droplets, aimed to disentangle the specific contribution of shear thinning and elastic effects on the sliding behavior. In particular the deviation from the linear (Newtonian) trend is more likely attributed to the emergence of normal stresses inside the non-Newtonian droplet.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Carboxymethyl chitosan-assisted uniformly anchored Pd nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes for methanol electrooxidation in alkaline media","Abstract":"A carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC)-assisted method is developed for the preparation of a palladium (Pd) nanoparticles (NPs)\/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) nanohybrid.

The binder material used for the cathode is therefore crucial as this is a key determinant of the bonding interactions between the active material (S) and electronic conducting support (C), as well as the maintenance of intimate contact between the electrode materials and current collector. Here, we investigated the application of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers as functional binders in Li-S batteries. Utilizing the high degree of surface functionalities, interior porosities, and polarity of the PAMAM dendrimers, it is demonstrated that high S loadings (>4 mg cm(-2)) can be easily achieved using simple processing methods. An exceptional electrochemical cycling performance was obtained as compared to cathodes with conventional linear polymeric binders such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), which was attributed to better interfacial interactions between the dendrimers and the C\/S composite materials, as well as better electrolyte wetting due to the dendrimer spherical molecular, porous architectures.

This type of concrete made of plant aggregates has particularly attractive thermal and hygroscopic properties. The hemp produced by agricultural holdings represents 10,000 ha in France whereas sunflower production is about 700,000 ha. The purpose of the article is to bring scientific elements which demonstrate that aggregates from the sunflower stem can be valorised in the same way as hemp hurd for the manufacturing of building materials. This study could encourage the development of new outlets for agricultural crops. Moreover, the sunflower aggregates could be available at low costs and promote a local economy as compared to hemp hurd. The experimental program includes the physical and thermal characterisation of the raw materials and the design of concrete where aggregates, obtained from an industrial grinding process, are associated with a binder. The characterisation of the aggregates mainly consists of the granulometric study by image analysis, the water absorption and the determination of thermal properties using especially the hot wire method. Two binders are used to prepare cylindrical specimens of sunflower concrete. Two kinds of mixture are tested in compression after 60 days, in thermal conductivity and capillary water absorption. The first one, called wall mixture, has a binder on aggregates mass ratio of 2 (B\/A = 2) and the second mixture, called roof mixture, has a B\/A mass ratio of 1. Hot wire test results demonstrate for the wall mixtures an average dry thermal conductivity of 0.096 +\/- 0.003 W m(-1) K-1 for the two binders. Compression results show an average compressive strength value at 60 days of 0.50 +\/- 0.1 MPa for the wall mixtures and 0.10 +\/- 0.01 MPa for the roof mixtures after an average 17 % strain. The results obviously show that the sunflower concrete reaches thermal and mechanical properties very close from those of hemp concrete.

Therefore, this facile and controllable method was applied to reduce GO in the GO\/MWCNTs composites, generating ecrGO\/MWCNTs composites. The ecrGO\/MWCNTs composites exhibit higher specific capacitance (C-sp) than ecrGO because the intercalation of MWCNTs into ecrGO sheets increases the surface areas, according to the TEM, XRD and N-2 adsorption-desorption results. The composites with different mass ratios of GO to MWCNTs (10:1, 5:1, 1:1, 1:5, 1:10) were investigated.

Non-ionic surfactants were used in CNF aqueous dispersions equilibrated with an organic phase (for demonstration, a polystyrene solution, PS, was used). Stable water-in-oil-in-water (W\/O\/W) double emulsions were produced as a result of the compromise between composition and formulation variables. Most remarkably, the proposed route for CNF integration with hydrophobic polymers removed the need for drying or solvent-exchange of the CNF aqueous dispersion prior to processing. The rheological behavior of the double emulsions showed strong shear thinning behavior and facilitated CNF-PS co-mixing in solid nanofibers upon electrospinning. The morphology and thermal properties of the resultant nanofibers revealed that CNFs were efficiently integrated in the hydrophobic matrix which was consistent with the high interfacial area of the precursor double emulsion.

The CNTs in the aerogels prevented the sliding between the graphene sheets and enhanced the stiffness of cell walls, which provided the aerogels with super-elasticity. Mechanical tests showed that the graphene\/CNT aerogels could fully recover without fracture even after 90% compression. The potential application of the sensing compressive strain for the aerogels was also demonstrated. The electrical resistance response of the aerogels was highly constant to the multiple cycles of compression. The strain-gauge sensitivity of graphene\/CNT aerogels could be tuned to considerably different values by controlling the aerogel density. Upon applying a strain of 30% and 60% to the graphene\/CNT aerogel with a density of 37.8 mg cm(-3), its strain-gauge sensitivities (gauge factor) reached 230% and 125%, respectively, which were superior to most of carbon-based compressible conductors.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Study on photogenerated charge transfer properties and enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity of p-type Bi2O3\/n-type ZnO heterojunctions","Abstract":"The composite Bi2O3\/ZnO photocatalyst, a novel p-n type heterojunction with different molar ratios of Bi to Zn, has been fabricated using a hydrothermal method. The XRD, XPS, UV-vis DRS, SEM, HRTEM studies were used to characterize the as-obtained products. The photocatalytic activities of the p-Bi2O3\/n-ZnO heterojunctions were investigated for their efficiency on the degradation of alizarin red (AR) dye under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm), and the results showed that the composites possessed remarkable photocatalytic activities, which were conducive to their separation, recycling, and reuse. The photogenerated charge-transfer properties were tested by surface photocurrent (SPC) and surface photovoltage (SPV) experiments and results show that the interfacial electric field located between Bi2O3 and ZnO played an important role in promoting the separation of photogenerated electron and hole pairs.

In this research, a meso-microporous carbon was prepared by the combination of a template method and chemical activation with earth abundant cellulose and lignosulphonate as the sources. The as-synthesized meso-microporous carbon contained mesopores generated by regeneration of cellulose with the assistance of a silica template, and micropores created by chemical activation of carbon. Such a unique porous structure makes the as-synthesized meso-microporous carbon the ideal electrode active material for energy storage. The two-electrode symmetric supercapacitors built using the meso-microporous carbon electrodes show a specific capacitance of 286 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.25 A g(-1) in aqueous electrolyte. More importantly, the symmetric supercapacitor achieves a high energy density of 13 W h kg(-1) while at a high power density of 27 kW kg(-1). It is demonstrated that using renewable natural sources for the manufacturing of porous carbon with high performance for energy storage can be an effective way to lower the cost of a supercapacitor.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Fabrication and characterization of elastic hollow nanofibrous PU yarn","Abstract":"Polyurethane (PU) has been applied to various nanofibrous structures owing to its tensile properties. High elasticity has established PU as a functional material with various applications such as artificial tendons, vascular grafts, protective clothing, wound dressing and 2D and 3D scaffolds. The main goal of this research is the fabrication and characterization of pristine and hollow yam from polyurethane nanofibers via the electrospinning process. In this work, PU nanofibrous yarn is successfully produced via the electrospinning process. The effect of the twist level on the mechanical properties is assessed by altering the twist level. Hollow yarn was produced by feeding PVA filaments as the core and dissolving them in warm water. High tenacity and superior elasticity were found to be unique properties of PU electrospun yarn. Increasing the twist level led to decreased tenacity of PU nanofibrous yarns. The surface morphology and diameter of the nanofibers and fractured yarns were studied by SEM and are reported.

Low angle X-ray scattering from oriented samples yielded 57 orders, more than twice as many as recorded previously. The determined electron density map has a sawtooth profile similar to the result from lower resolution data, but the features are sharper allowing better estimates for the modulated bilayer profile and the distribution of headgroups along the aqueous interface. Analysis of high resolution wide angle X-ray data shows that the hydrocarbon chains in the longer, major side of the asymmetric sawtooth are packed similarly to the L-beta F gel phase, with chains in both monolayers coupled and tilted by 18 degrees in the same direction. The absence of Bragg rods that could be associated with the minor side is consistent with disordered chains, as often suggested in the literature. However, the new high resolution bilayer profile strongly suggests that the chains in the two monolayers in the minor side and the curved region are not in registry. This staggered monolayer modulated melting suggests a direction for improving theories of the ripple phase.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Extensional viscosity of copper nanowire suspensions in an aqueous polymer solution","Abstract":"Suspensions of copper nanowires are emerging as new electronic inks for next-generation flexible electronics. Using a novel surface acoustic wave driven extensional flow technique we are able to perform currently lacking analysis of these suspensions and their complex buffer. We observe extensional viscosities from 3 mPa s (1 mPa s shear viscosity) to 37.2 Pa s via changes in the suspension concentration, thus capturing low viscosities that have been historically very challenging to measure. These changes equate to an increase in the relative extensional viscosity of nearly 12 200 times at a volume fraction of just 0.027. We also find that interactions between the wires and the necessary polymer additive affect the rheology strongly. Polymer-induced elasticity shows a reduction as the buffer relaxation time falls from 819 to 59 mu s above a critical particle concentration. The results and technique presented here should aid in the future formulation of these promising nanowire suspensions and their efficient application as inks and coatings.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Phenol-urea-formaldehyde resin co-polymer synthesis and its influence on Elaeis palm trunk plywood mechanical performance evaluated by C-13 NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry","Abstract":"This study evaluated a new method of producing phenol-urea-formaldehyde (PUF) adhesives formulated differently under actual \"in-situ\" resin synthesis conditions.

Matrix assisted laser desorption Ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) illustrated and confirmed a series number of the phenol-urea co-condensates repeating unit in the prepared PUF resins which corroborated well with its mechanical properties (modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture), bonding quality (dry test and weather boil proof or WBP test) and physical properties. A series of PF, UF and PUF resins oligomers forming repeating units up to 1833 Da were identified. Besides that, the solid state (13)Carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) interpretation identified that the signal at 44-45 ppm and 54-55 ppm corresponding to methylene bridges were co-condensated in between phenol and urea in the PUF resin system. The C-13 NMR investigation showed that the synthesis process of PUF resin contained no free formaldehyde elements. Furthermore, the proportion of urea and methylolureas in the mixture to synthesis PUF resin were sufficient and incorporated well into the formulation by reacting with LMWPF units to form co-condensed methylene bridges.

In this work, insoluble chitosan\/gelatin-B (CH\/GB) complex particles were used for the first time as effective Pickering emulsifiers to make long-term stable oil-in-water emulsions and emulsion gels by one-step homogenization. The CH\/GB complexes were only formed in the oppositely charged pH region via electrostatic complexation of CH and GB, and the pH showed a remarkable effect on the surface activity of CH\/GB mixed systems. The presence of CH\/GB insoluble complexes significantly decreased the surface tension of the oil\/water interface, therefore benefitting the formation of smaller emulsion droplet sizes and effectively hindering droplet coalescence, as supported by the increase of emulsion long-term stability. Increasing the oil volume fraction considerably accelerated the formation of a droplet network structure, resulting in a solid-like thermoreversible emulsion gel with tunable viscoelastic properties. Our results suggest that CH\/GB insoluble complex particles are promising particulate emulsifiers for the preparation of surfactant-free Pickering emulsions as well as emulsion gels.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"An overview of advances in biomass gasification","Abstract":"Biomass gasification is a widely used thermochemical process for obtaining products with more value and potential applications than the raw material itself.

At first, in the pretreatment step, the mixture of 1.0 g dried bark powder and 10 mL deionized water were irradiated by microwave under 500 W for 10 min. Then, in hydrolysis step, the optimal conditions were as follows: 0.5 mg\/mL of cellulase concentration, 4.0 pH of enzyme solution, 24 h of incubation time and 40 degrees C of incubation temperature. After incubation, 10 mL ethanol was added to extract genipin for 30 min by ultrasound. After EHSE treatment, the yield of genipin could reach 1.71 mol\/g.

Although some of these pretreatment processes are nowadays developed at pilot scale, they are not always cost effective, and they are responsible for environmental impacts. Recently, mechanocatalysis pretreatment emerged as a promising technology for the activation and deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. In particular, these dry processes have the potential to limit the use of solvent and the production of liquid effluents. In this study, we propose an innovative one-pot eco-friendly approach based on the combination of dry chemical and vibro-ball-milling (VBM) for biomass activation, coupled to enzymatic conversion without an external source of heating, and without the assistance of any organic solvent. NaOH activation coupling to VBM fractionation for 10, 30, and 60 min was compared to H3PO4, H2O2, betaine, and betaine-Cl activation. NaOH-VBM-10 min appears more effective in sugar production compared to other chemical-mechanical activation. NaOH-VBM in 10 min consumed less energy, resulting in higher energy efficiency compared to that of other chemical-mechanical activation. Therefore, NaOH-VBM-10 min appears the most suitable and interesting pretreatment for the production of sugars and biofuels from corn stover biomass.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Homogeneous benzoylation of cellulose in 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride: Hammett correlation, mechanism and regioselectivity","Abstract":"Homogeneous benzoylation of cellulose with a series of substituted benzoyl chlorides, in which substituents varied from electron donating to electron withdrawing groups, was investigated in an ionic liquid 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (AmimCl). The electronic effect of substituents had a considerable effect on the reaction. A plot of Hammett parameters of substituents vs. degree of substitution (DS) of resultant cellulose esters exhibited a V-shaped graph: a negative slope for negative Hammett parameters, and a positive slope for positive Hammett parameters. Such a Hammett plot indicated the mechanism of cellulose benzoylation: the reaction underwent a unimolecular ionization mechanism with a carbocationic intermediate when benzoyl chlorides were with electron-donating substituents, and a bimolecular addition-elimination mechanism with a tetrahedral intermediate when benzoyl chlorides were with electron-withdrawing substituents. In addition, C-13-NMR analysis showed that most of the substituted benzoyl chlorides exclusively preferred the primary hydroxyl at the C-6 position. This unusually high regioselectivity was attributed to the synergistic effect of appropriate reaction rate, moderate steric effect and reaction mechanism of benzoylation.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Sortase A-mediated multi-functionalization of protein nanoparticles","Abstract":"We report here a new strategy to enable fast, covalent, and site-directed functionalization of protein nanoparticles using Sortase A-mediated ligation using functional proteins ranging from monomeric to large tetrameric structures.

To solve these issues, chemical, thermal, and electrochemical procedures are traditionally employed to reduce GO nanosheets. However, these strategies are still unscalable, consume high amounts of energy, and are expensive for practical application. Here, for the first time, we describe the superior Na storage of unreduced GO by a simple and scalable alkali-metal-ion (Li+, Na+, K+)-functionalized process. The various alkali metals ions, connecting with the oxygen on GO, have played different effects on morphology, porosity, degree of disorder, and electrical conductivity, which are crucial for Na-storage capabilities. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that sodium-ion-functionalized GO (GNa) has shown outstanding Na-storage performance in terms of excellent rate capability and long-term cycle life (110 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles at 1 Ag-1) owing to its high BET area, appropriate mesopore, high degree of disorder, and improved electrical conductivity. Theoretical calculations were performed using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to further study the Na-storage capabilities of functionalized GO. These calculations have indicated that the Na-O bond has the lowest binding energy, which is beneficial to insertion\/extraction of the sodium ion, hence the GNa has shown the best Na-storage properties among all comparatives functionalized by other alkali metal ions.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"The mechanoelectrical response of droplet interface bilayer membranes","Abstract":"Mechanotransduction and interfacial properties in unsupported liquid biomimetic membranes are explored using the droplet-interface bilayer technique.

A four-aqueous-phase flow jet with an intermediate buffer flow between the Ca2+-containing and alginate-containing flows is used as the template for microfiber fabrication. The buffer flow efficiently controls the diffusion of Ca2+ into the alginate-containing flow as well as the crosslinking reaction, thus ensuring the continuous fabrication of hollow Ca-alginate microfibers under relatively low flow rates without clogging of the microchannel. The structure of the hollow microfibers can be flexibly adjusted by changing the flow rates and device dimensions.

ASDs of indomethacin (IND) were prepared in several polymers which exhibit different solubility behaviors in acidic (pH 1.2) and basic (pH 7.4) dissolution media. The selected polymers range from water-soluble (e.g., PVP and Soluplus) andwater-insoluble (e.g., ethylcellulose and Eudragit RL PO) to those only soluble in an acidic or basic dissolution medium (e.g., Eudragit E100, Eudragit L100, and HPMCAS). At 20 wt.% drug loading, DSC and powder XRD analysis confirmed that the majority of incorporated IND was present in an amorphous state. Our nonsink dissolution results confirm that whether the carrier matrix is medium soluble determines the release mechanism of amorphous drugs from ASD systems which has a direct impact on the rate of supersaturation generation, thus in turn affecting the evolution of supersaturation in amorphous systems. For example, under nonsink dissolution conditions, the release of amorphous IND from medium-soluble carriers is governed by a dissolution-controlled mechanism-leading to an initial surge of supersaturation followed by a sharp decline in drug concentration due to rapid nucleation and crystallization. In contrast, the dissolution of INDASD from medium-insoluble carriers is more gradual as drug release is regulated by a diffusion-controlled mechanism by which drug supersaturation is built up gradually and sustained over an extended period of time without any apparent decline. Since several tested carrier polymers can be switched from soluble to insoluble by simply changing the pH of the dissolution medium, the results obtained here provide unequivocal evidence of the proposed transition of kinetic solubility profiles from the same ASD system induced by changes in the drug release mechanism in dissolution medium of a different pH.

Obtaining an improved understanding of the fundamental chemistry of lignin, the most recalcitrant component of biomass, during pretreatment is critical to the continued development of renewable biofuel production. To examine the intrinsic chemistry of lignin during dilute acid pretreatment (DAP), lignin was isolated from poplar and switchgrass using a cellulolytic enzyme system and then treated under DAP conditions. Our results highlight that lignin is subjected to depolymerization reactions within the first 2 min of dilute acid pretreatment and these changes are accompanied by increased generation of aliphatic and phenolic hydroxyl groups of lignin. This is followed by a competing set of depolymerization and repolymerization reactions that lead to a decrease in the content of guaiacyl lignin units and an increase in condensed lignin units as the reaction residence time is extended beyond 5 min. A detailed comparison of changes in functional groups and molecular weights of cellulolytic enzyme lignins demonstrated different structural parameters, related to the recalcitrant properties of lignin, are altered during DAP conditions.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"In situ upgrading of whole biomass to biofuel precursors with low average molecular weight and acidity by the use of zeolite mixture","Abstract":"The pyrolysis of whole biomass-pine wood and bark-with mordenite (M), beta (beta) and Y zeolites has been examined at 600 degrees C.

For this purpose, a highly efficient tubular dielectric barrier discharge reactor is built to allow the continuous treatment of \"endless\" cylindrical substrates. The best treatment conditions found regarding adhesion are Ar\/O-2 plasma pretreatment, followed by the deposition from dichloromethane of a 75 nm-thick organo-chlorinated plasma polymerized thin film. Ar\/O-2, pretreatment allows the removal of organic residues, coming from drawing lubricants, and induces external growth of zinc oxide. The plasma layer has to be preferably deposited at low power to conserve sufficient hydrocarbon moieties. Surface analyses reveal the complex chemical mechanism behind the establishment of strong adhesion levels, more than five times higher after the plasma treatment. During the vulcanization step, superficial ZnO reacts with the chlorinated species of the thin film and is converted into porous and granular bump-shaped ZnwOxHyClz nanostructures. Together, rubber additives diffuse through the plasma layer and lead to the formation of zinc sulfide on the substrate surface. Hence, two distinct interfaces, rubber\/thin film and thin film\/substrate, are established. On the basis of these observations, hypotheses explaining the high bonding strength results are formulated.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Preparation of Modified Magnetic Nano-Fe3O4 Chitosan\/Graphene Oxide for the Preconcentration and Determination of Copper (II) ions in Biological and Environmental Water Samples Prior to Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry","Abstract":"A simple, highly sensitive, accurate and selective method for determination of trace amounts of Cu2+ in water samples.

In the hydrothermal process, graphene oxide is both employed as the precursor for the central graphene filling and a sheet-like template for both-side formation of N-doped porous carbon layers, resulting in an N-doped carbon sandwich structure (N-CS). This carbon sandwich is about 50-70 nm in thickness and has a high specific surface area (similar to 2677 m(2) g(-1)) and a large pore volume (similar to 1.8 cm(3) g(-1)), making it a promising high capacity reservoir for sulfur and polysulfide in a lithium-sulfur cell. The sheet-like morphology and the interconnected pore structure of the N-CS, together with a nitrogen content of 2.2%, are transformed to the assembled N-CS\/sulfur cell with a high rate performance and excellent cycling stability because of fast ion diffusion and electron transfer. At a 2C rate, the reversible capacity is up to 625 mA h g(-1) and remains at 461 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles with only 0.13% capacity fading per cycle. More interestingly, the sheet-like structure helps the N-CS materials form a tightly stacked coating on an electrode sheet, guaranteeing a volumetric capacity as high as 350 mA h cm(-3).","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Next-generation ammonia pretreatment enhances cellulosic biofuel production","Abstract":"A new liquid ammonia pretreatment methodology called Extractive Ammonia (EA) was developed to simultaneously convert native crystalline cellulose I-beta (CI) to a highly digestible cellulose IIII (CIII) allomorph and selectively extract up to B45% of the lignin from lignocellulosic biomass with near-quantitative retention of all polysaccharides. EA pretreated corn stover yielded a higher fermentable sugar yield compared to the older Ammonia Fiber Expansion (AFEX) process while using 60% lower enzyme loading. The EA process preserves extracted lignin functionalities, offering the potential to co-produce lignin-derived fuels and chemicals in the biorefinery. The single-stage EA fractionation process achieves high biofuel yields (18.2 kg ethanol per 100 kg untreated corn stover, dry weight basis), comparable to those achieved using ionic liquid pretreatments. The EA process achieves these ethanol yields at industrially-relevant conditions using low enzyme loading (7.5 mg protein per g glucan) and high solids loading (8% glucan, w\/v).","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"High-performance Na2Ti2O5 nanowire arrays coated with VS2 nanosheets for sodium-ion storage","Abstract":"Na2Ti2O5 (NTO) nanowire arrays coated with VS2 nanosheets (NTO-VS2) have been directly prepared on a current collector as a 3D anode for Na-ion batteries. Compared to graphite, the larger interlayer spacing of two dimensional VS2 can offer facile intercalation of lithium and\/or sodium ions. Aside from its natural metallic behavior, VS2 also possesses a high theoretical capacity. The composite NTO-VS2 nanowire arrays as an additive free 3D anode shows superior electrochemical performance compared to NTO. After 50 (C\/10) and 100 (1C) cycles, the charge capacities of NTO-VS2 are maintained, respectively, at 298 and 203 mA h g(-1), which are much higher than the values of 157 and 93 mA h g(-1) observed for the same cycled Na2Ti2O5 electrodes. The higher capacity, improved rate capability, and good stability of the composite NTO-VS2 nanowire arrays are due to the structural stability of the Na2Ti2O5 nanowire arrays and the higher capacity and conductivity of the two-dimensional VS2 nanosheets.

The nanoparticle matrices were synthesized and the insecticides encapsulated in situ during the chemical reduction of silver nitrate by glucose employing direct heating. The starch silver nanoparticle encapsulation of dichlorvos (ST-AgNP-VOS) and chlorpyrifos (ST-AgNP-FOS) was confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy and characterized by HR-TEM, EDX, SAED, FTIR, XRD and FESEM. The characteristic colour of AgNPs was observed and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the materials was found to be in the range of 418-422 nm. In addition, the XRD results revealed the silver identification diffraction peaks at 20 angles in each formulation. The insecticide encapsulation efficiency was about 95% for ST-AgNP-VOS and 98% for ST-AgNP-FOS. Compared to control having no silver (NDVOS), both materials showed better insecticide loading. Their HR-TEM images indicated spherical natures of the materials with an average particle size range of 23-35 nm. The FESEM image showed spheres as well and a size close to that indicated by HR-TEM analysis. FTIR also confirmed the loading of dichlorvos and chlorpyrifos with additional peaks corresponding to them, compared to the insecticide-free starch. These nano-insecticide formulations were subjected to aqueous release studies. The result showed an enhanced release over the formulation without silver nanoparticles. It was concluded that this approach could be used to prepare slow release formulations of these insecticides, with the advantage of the silver nanoparticles also acting as an anti-microbial agent.

The Cu\/DNA\/n-InP contact showed a good rectifying behavior. The ideality factor value of 1.08 and the barrier height (Phi(b)) value of 0.70 eV for the Cu\/DNA\/n-InP device were determined from the forward bias I-V characteristics. It was seen that the Phi(b) value of 0.70 eV obtained for the Cu\/DNA\/n-InP contact was significantly larger than the value of 0.48 eV of conventional Cu\/n-InP Schottky diodes. Modification of the interfacial potential barrier of Cu\/n-InP diode was achieved using a thin interlayer of DNA biopolymer.

The critical issues in PEC water splitting include the development of the photoelectrode materials with high efficiency and long-term stability, especially for p-type semiconductor photocathodes. Herein, we report the use of citric acid (CA) pyrolysis to prepare carbon-shell-decorated PbMoO4 (C@PbMoO4) nanocrystals via a simple solvothermal method. Different carbon shell thicknesses below 10 nm were generated by varying the amount of CA in the precursor solution. In contrast, without using CA, bare PbMoO4 nanocrystals were obtained. The PEC experiments showed that 2-nm carbon shell could preferably improve the water splitting performance of PbMoO4: the photocurrent density of 2-nm C@PbMoO4 is nearly 2-fold high as that of bare PbMoO4 at 0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The surface charge transfer efficiency of 2-nm C@PbMoO4 in the PEC process was tested to increase from 83% to 90.4%, the charge separation efficiency enhanced 56%, and the PEC stability also greatly increased compared to those of the bare PbMoO4 nanocrystals.

CuO nanospheres were synthesized by a simple wet chemical method and were subsequently embedded into the biopolymer matrix (chitosan) under mild conditions by the solution cast method and its photocatalytic application towards the degradation of organic pollutants was measured for the first time. The crystal structure, optical properties, surface and bulk morphology were discussed in detail. ICP-OES analysis showed 3.025% copper embedded in the chitosan (CS) matrix. Efficiency of the CuO\/chitosan was evaluated against the degradation of rhodamine B dye as a probe. The combination of CuO nanospheres with chitosan leads to the higher efficiency of up to 99% degradation of the dye with 60 minutes of irradiation. This may be attributed to many features such as the slow electron hole pair recombination rate of nanosized CuO in the biopolymer matrix, the large surface area of the CuO and the high adsorption efficiency of the chitosan. The major advantage of this present protocol is that it is not only restricted to azo type dyes but can also be adopted for different kinds of organic pollutants. For all the types of organic contaminants tested, the CuO\/chitosan nanocomposite thin film photocatalyst showed excellent activity. The facile hand-picking recovery and recyclability of this novel thin film likely opens up a new straightforward strategy in the effective photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"The role of a xylose isomerase pathway in the conversion of xylose to lipid in Mucor circinelloides","Abstract":"The xylose isomerase (XI) pathway, which converts xylose in lignocellulosic materials into intermediate metabolites, does not commonly exist in filamentous fungi. The genomic sequence of Mucor circinelloides shows that it has the XI pathway but it has never been characterized. In this study, the genes coding for XI and xylulokinase (XK) were overexpressed in Mucor circinelloides to examine their effects on xylose utilization and the xylose metabolism pathway. The results showed that overexpressing XI or XK increased the total consumption rate of xylose and the lipid yield. In the lipid accumulation phase, the mRNA levels of XI and XK, and activities of XI, XK, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) in recombinant strains were higher than the control.

Using tanninbased (green) corrosion inhibitors reduces water and energy consumption, greenhouse gases emissions, and contaminants in effluent wastewaters, while reducing the environmental footprint of industrial processes. The surface adsorptive and corrosion protective properties of a commercial tannin-based corrosion inhibitor (TG 3300) for mild steel were investigated in an alkaline environment using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, open circuit potential, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed the formation of an effective and stable tannin-based protective layer on mild steel within the first 5 min to 15 min of adsorption. It was found that adsorption of TG 3300 on mild steel can be well described by the Langmuir isotherm. Highly negative values of apparent Gibbs free energy of adsorption (Delta G(ads) = -47.36 kJ\/mol), indicate a spontaneous and strong adsorption of TG 3300 onto the mild steel surface. The results suggest the formation of a TG 3300 protective layer on mild steel, where the highest value of inhibition efficiency was 85% under the applied experimental conditions.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Evaluation of Antioxidant, Antidiabetic and Anticholinesterase Activities of Smallanthus sonchifolius Landraces and Correlation with Their Phytochemical Profiles","Abstract":"The present study aimed to investigate the phytochemical profile of leaf methanol extracts of fourteen Smallanthus sonchifolius (yacon) landraces and their antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antidiabetic activities that could lead to the finding of more effective agents for the treatment and management of Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. For this purpose, antioxidant activity was assessed using different tests: ferric reducing ability power (FRAP), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH), nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O-2(-)) scavenging and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays. Anticholinesterase activity was investigated by quantifying the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activities, whereas antidiabetic activity was investigated by -amylase and -glucosidase inhibition tests. To understand the contribution of metabolites, phytochemical screening was also performed by high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) system.

The BD\/GCCA electrostatic complex was used as a complex emulsifier to produce Fe3O4 and paclitaxel loaded emulsion by high pressure homogenization.

In vivo investigations verified that the emulsion, administrated via the tail vein and guided by an external magnetic field, significantly enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy and reduced the toxicity of paclitaxel as well as improved the tumor contrast effect in T-2-weighted MRI.

This review thoroughly summarized the emerging efforts in understanding interactions between MNPs and NOM. The main environmental processes influenced by NOM are adsorption, stabilization\/aggregation, dissolution and surface transformation. Adsorption, competition and desorption irreversibility of NOM on the MNP surface were discussed with regard to NOM properties. For soluble MNPs, their dissolution was generally promoted after interacting with NOM although dissolution suppression was also reported. Besides dissolution, two main surface transformation processes including oxidation and sulfidation can occur on the MNP surface in the presence of NOM. The relationship between NOM-induced dispersion and other processes such as adsorption, dissolution and surface transformation was discussed. Due to the alteration of the above environmental processes, NOM can have an impact on the toxicity of MNPs on aquatic organisms. Therefore, the toxicity of MNPs in the presence of different types of NOM was addressed. It is concluded that NOM can alter MNP toxicity through changing suspension stabilization of MNPs, bioavailability of metal ions dissolved from MNPs, electrostatic interactions and steric repulsion between MNPs and organisms, and MNP-induced reactive oxygen species generation. However, the impact of MNP transformation induced by NOM on toxicity needs further investigations. Moreover, mesocosm studies and mathematical models are suggested to examine the environmental processes of MNPs in the presence of NOM in large-scale aquatic systems. Several key research challenges are provided at the end of this review.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Modified Separator Using Thin Carbon Layer Obtained from Its Cathode for Advanced Lithium Sulfur Batteries","Abstract":"The realization of a practical lithium sulfur battery system, despite its high theoretical specific capacity, is severely limited by fast capacity decay, which is mainly attributed to polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effect.

The product evolution was monitored by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and the key finding is that the liquefaction involves several major chemical events in the following sequence: (1) the process starts with partial formylation of the hydroxyl groups in chitin side chains generating soluble polymeric derivatives; (2) formic acid catalyzes polymer chain breakage in a non-conventional, non-hydrolytic pathway forming dehydrated monomers and oligomers; (3) as formylation continues, water accumulates in the system, which induces more monomer and oligomer generation via hydrolysis, and the formation of rehydrated products.

PPC possessed a chlorophyll : lutein : protein ratio of 94 : 153 : 100 (w\/w\/w) according to HPLC and spectrophotometric analysis. Various antioxidant evaluation systems were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of PPC in vitro. Results showed that PPC exhibited significant DPPH radical scavenging activity with an IC50 of 313 mu g mL(-1). Distinct Fe2+ ion chelating activity, reducing capacity and lipid peroxidation inhibition activity were observed at a concentration of 1 mg mL(-1). For the hepatoprotective effects, administration of PPC at different concentrations (50 and 100 mg kg(-1) BW) could significantly decrease the carbon tetrachloride-induced elevation of the hepatosomatic index. Increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities were attenuated with PPC pretreatment. In addition, PPC effectively restored suppressed hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities. Moreover, PPC significantly reduced the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA). The results obtained from this study clearly verified the hepatoprotective effect of PPC in CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in vivo, suggesting that PPC has the potential to be exploited as a dietary supplement against free radical oxidation which could enhance resistivity against oxidative stress in the human body.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Incorporation of polymeric microparticles into collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffolds for the delivery of a pro-osteogenic peptide for bone tissue engineering","Abstract":"Collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffolds are outstanding materials for bone tissue engineering as they are biocompatible, bioresorbable, osteoconductive, and osteoinductive. The objective of the present work was to assess the potential of increasing their regenerative capacity by functionalising the scaffolds for therapeutic delivery.

With this purpose, alginate, chitosan, gelatine, and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles eluting PTHrP 107-111, an osteogenic pentapeptide, were fabricated and tested by incorporating them into the scaffolds.

Following the incorporation of the microparticles, the scaffolds maintained their interconnected porous structure and the mechanical properties of the materials were not adversely affected. In addition, the microparticles released all their PTHrP 107-111 cargo.

Functionalization of ZrO2 has been carried out using sulfophenylphosphonate which was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared spectrographs. The electrostatic intercalation of chitosan with filler particles was monitored using electrochemical impedance analyzer which exhibits lowest bulk resistance which is highly effective for ionic switching. Incorporation of zirconium sulfophenylphosphonate (ZrSP) the ionic conductivity of the chitosan film attained a value of 1.2 x 10(-6) S\/cm as compared to the unmodified one which is a prefeasibility work for the fabrication of biosensing platform. Variation in performance characteristics has been evaluated through morphological and thermal characterization. TGA and DSC analysis reveal that the thermal stability and decomposition temperature of the nanocomposites were improved by the addition of reinforcing filler particles.

Tremendous effort has been directed at improving photovoltaic (PV) conversion efficiencies, resulting in dramatic device performance increases over the past two decades for novel, cost-effective PV systems. Nevertheless, performance issues related to device stability, scalability, and flexibility prevent these novel designs from achieving their market potential. For mechanically flexible architectures, integration of new materials such as graphene-derived nanomaterials (i.e. graphene\/graphite oxide and their modified analogs with other nanocarbons and carbon nanotubes) may be necessary to enhance alternatives to silicon-based PV systems. Among the diverse solar technologies, perovskite solar cells-most notably organometal halides-have stood out from the crowd with solar efficiencies over 20% and potential for highly scalable manufacturing. Here, we review the use of graphene and graphene-derived nanomaterials in new designs of perovskite solar cells associated with organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites utilized as light-harvesting layers, outlining design perspectives, device characterization, and performance. Recent efforts to clarify stability issues and efficiency control mechanisms are also briefly discussed, and we provide some perspective on the currently available literature and future research directions in the field.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Complex Formation of Divalent Cations with Carboxylic Acid Resins as a Factor Determining Different Stationary States of Their Swelling","Abstract":"Three samples of carboxylic acid gel-type cross-linked polyelectrolytes were examined by registering the extent and kinetics of their volume change depending on the temperature, concentration, and nature of external electrolyte solutions, as well as the initial state (ionic form, water content) of the bead. It is found that in some systems the swelling of the bead (as a result of lowering the temperature) proceeds much more slowly than the preceding shrinking (as a result of the increase of temperature). Moreover, the initial volume of the bead is not restored, and a new stationary state of swelling is established. By means of optical dilatometry, it is found that in the systems in which the differences in the stationary states of swelling are found, the beads display plasto-elastic properties, whereas in the absence of such differences the beads show elastic properties. It is found that different stationary states of swelling are also established when the beads of copolymer of methacrylic acid cross-linked with divinylbenzene in Na+ form in the dry state and in the NaCl solution-swollen state are placed into a solution of a divalent cation salt. The difference in the stationary states of swelling reaches 12% in 4 N NiCl2 solution. The substantial differences in the swelling behavior and viscoelastic properties of the resins in their Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Ni2+ forms are interpreted in terms of formation of different kinds of complexes of functional groups of the polymer with Ca2+ and Ni2+ ions.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Sustained Water Oxidation by Direct Electrosynthesis of Ultrathin Organic Protection Films on Silicon","Abstract":"Artificial photosynthesis allows exceeding the efficiency and stability limits of natural photosynthesis. Based on the use of semiconducting absorbers, high efficiency in water photolysis has been achieved in various photoelectrode configurations. However, integrated systems are limited in their stability, and more stable half-cell electrodes use protection films prepared by laborious methods. Herein, the facile low-temperature preparation of ultrathin organic protection coatings is demonstrated. The formation is based on the catalytic properties of water oxidation catalysts toward alcohol-polymerization reactions, which results in the formation of hitherto unknown protection layers on silicon. The interfacial layers are generated via iodine-mediated electro-reductive polymerization of ethanol, concomitantly forming during electrophoretic transport of RuO2 onto silicon supports. Reaction chemistry analyses show that the RuO2-induced catalysis introduces E2-elimination reactions which result in a carbon sp(3)-sp(2) transformation of the film. For the two modes of photoelectrochemical operation, the photovoltaic and the photoelectrocatalytic mode, 20 and 15 mA cm(-2) photocurrent densities, respectively, are obtained with unaltered output for 8 and 24 h. The interfacial layer enables Si photovoltages of 500 mV, demonstrating extraordinary electronic interface quality. Since only hydrogen termination of the surface is a prerequisite for growth of the organic protection layer, the method is applicable to a wide range of semiconductors.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"A perspective on bioethanol production from biomass as alternative fuel for spark ignition engine","Abstract":"The increasing consumption of fossil fuels has led to the development of alternative fuels for the future. Domestic biofuel production and the utilization of alternative fuels can decrease dependency on petroleum oil, reduce trade deficits, reduce air pollution and reduce carbon dioxide emission. Bioethanol is a renewable fuel produced by the fermentation of sugar which is derived from plants such as sugarcane or beet, maize, or cassava etc. However, bioethanol consumption in an engine is approximately 51% higher than gasoline since the energy per unit volume of ethanol is 34% lower than for gasoline. Bioethanol is an oxygenated fuel that contains 35% oxygen, which can reduce particulate matter and NOx emissions caused by combustion of the fuel. Therefore, bioethanol-gasoline blends can significantly reduce petroleum use and GHG emission. In addition, utilization of lignocellulosic materials in bioethanol production is the most viable pathway from an environmental point of view. This paper reviews the current status and technologies involved in bioethanol production and the properties and engine performance from various biomass feedstocks which are the recommended sustainable alternative fuel in the future.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Thermodynamics of cell-penetrating HIV1 TAT peptide insertion into PC\/PS\/CHOL model bilayers through transmembrane pores: the roles of cholesterol and anionic lipids","Abstract":"Efficient delivery of pharmaceutically active molecules across cellular membranes using cell penetrating peptides (CPPs), such as the cationic human immunodeficiency virus-1 trans-acting activator of transcription peptide (HIV-1 TAT), continues to attract scientific attention in drug design and disease treatment. Experimental results show that the TAT peptide is not only capable of directly penetrating the biological membrane in a passive manner, but also forming physical, membrane-spanning pores that may facilitate transport. Experiments further show that anionic lipids accelerate peptide permeation within a range of mole percentage composition. In this work, we explored the structures and translocation thermodynamics of the cationic TAT peptide across a series of DPPC\/DPPS model membranes with the presence of 0-30 mol% cholesterol. We computed the potentials of the mean force by using umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations coupled to the Martini coarse-grained force field. We systematically investigated the roles of cholesterol and anionic lipids (membrane surface charge) in TAT peptide translocation. In qualitative agreement with experimental findings, the barrier heights were significantly reduced in the presence of anionic lipids. A toroidal hydrophilic pore was strongly suggested by membrane structure analysis. Cholesterol stabilizes the liquid-ordered (Lo) phase of membranes and increases the elastic stiffness of bilayers. Consequently, it hinders transmembrane pore formation and thus modulates solute permeability, since the liquid-ordered phase suppresses reorientation of the lipid molecules on simulation time scales. Though cholesterol contributes marginally to the total free energy associated with peptide permeation, the coordination of cholesterol to the peptide weakens more favorable peptide-lipid interactions. The addition of the anionic lipid DPPS to the neutral DPPC bilayer leads to the emergence and further enhancement of an interfacially stable state of the peptide due to the favorable peptide-anionic lipid interactions. Translocation free energy barriers decrease in lockstep with increasing DPPS composition in the model bilayers simulated. Finally, we investigated the size of hydrophilic pores emerging in our simulations, as well as the qualitative mobility of the peptide on the membrane surface.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Nanofibrous rhPDGF-eluting PLGA-collagen hybrid scaffolds enhance healing of diabetic wounds","Abstract":"Patients with chronic, non-healing diabetic ulcers extend hospital stays and increase the financial burden more than non-diabetics. This investigation developed nanofibrous growth factor-eluting poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-collagen hybrid scaffolds that enabled the sustainable release of recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF) to treat diabetic wounds. RhPDGF, collagen, and PLGA were dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol, and then electrospun into nanofibrous scaffolds. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and an elution method were utilized to evaluate the rates of in vivo and in vitro release of growth factors from the scaffolds. High concentrations and effectiveness of rhPDGF were documented for over three weeks. The water contact angles of nanofibrous rhPDGF-eluting PLGA-collagen hybrid scaffolds were less (97.2 +\/- 0.7 degrees) than those of PLGA-collagen hybrid mesh (107.6 +\/- 1.0 degrees) or virgin PLGA (113 +\/- 3.3 degrees) (all post hoc p < 0.05). The nanofibers with rhPDGF-eluting PLGA-collagen hybrid scaffold also exhibited significantly higher water-retaining capacity than those in other groups (all post hoc p < 0.001). Furthermore, the scaffolds caused more re-epithelialization and contained more collagen I in rats with rhPDGF-eluting scaffolds than controls, as determined from the expressed matrix metalloproteinase 9 in the hair canals in developing hair follicles. These results revealed for the first time, the application of rhPDGF as a growth factor adjuvant, and developed a new collagen-based composite with potent cell infiltration and epithelialization properties.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Fe-Fe3C\/C microspheres as a lightweight microwave absorbent","Abstract":"As electromagnetic pollution is becoming more and more serious, novel composite microwave absorbents are gaining much attention.

The results showed that the Fe-Fe3C nanoparticles were uniformly loaded on the carbon microspheres. Resulting from the synergistic effect of Fe-Fe3C nanoparticles and partially graphitized carbon, a wide region of microwave absorption was achieved due to dual dielectric and magnetic losses. An effective bandwidth of reflection loss less than -10 dB could reach up to 4 GHz with 1.5 mm thickness.

Two kinds of cysteine-terminated heptapeptides were studied. One peptide had alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues with an amphiphilic sequence of CYSYSYS. The other peptide (CRERERE) was zwitterionic. Both peptides were covalently attached onto gold substrates via gold thiol bond formation. Surface plasmon resonance analysis results showed that both peptide SAMs had ultralow or low protein adsorption amounts of 1.97-11.78 ng\/cm(2) in the presence of single proteins. The zwitterionic peptide showed relatively higher antifouling ability with single proteins and natural complex protein media. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to understand their respective antifouling behaviors. The results indicated that strong surface hydration of peptide SAMs contributes to fouling resistance by impeding interactions with proteins. Compared to the CYSYSYS peptide, more water molecules were predicted to form hydrogen-bonding interactions with the zwitterionic CRERERE peptide, which is in agreement with the antifouling test results. These findings reveal a clear relation between peptide structures and resistance to protein adsorption, facilitating the development of novel peptide-containing antifouling materials.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Applied hydrogen storage research and development: A perspective from the US Department of Energy","Abstract":"To enable the wide-spread commercialization of hydrogen fuel cell technologies, the U.S. Department of Energy, through the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's Fuel Cell Technology Office, maintains a comprehensive portfolio of R&D activities to develop advanced hydrogen storage technologies.

However, the reinforcing effect of these nanoparticles is not as efficient for the elastic properties as expected from the classical models for polymer composites or fibrous materials. In this study, nanocomposite films made of TEMPO-oxidized NFCs and polyethylene oxide (PEO) were prepared by varying the NFC content over a wide range. The structural properties of these materials were characterized using AFM, TEM, SEM-FEG and XRD. These techniques showed that NFC nanocomposite films and nanopapers consisted of dense networks of tortuous NFCs with planar and random orientations. DMA experiments also revealed that the cohesive bonds between NFCs greatly contributed to the overall elastic response of these nanocomposites, even for low NFC contents. Based on these observations, we report an original multiscale network model that describes the elastic properties of NFC nanocomposites and nanopapers where the governing deformation mechanisms occurred at the numerous bonds between NFCs and in the NFC kinked regions, whereas the crystalline NFC regions were considered to be rigid bodies. This approach led to the formulation of an analytical expression for the stiffness tensors of NFC nanocomposites and nanopapers and revealed the effects of the network structure on their mechanical responses. The model predictions were satisfactory over the range of investigated NFC contents. In particular, this model showed the predominant role of the amorphous regions on the elastic response, whereas the contribution of the NFC-NFC bonds became significant at high NFC contents.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"The MIA Pathway: A Key Regulator of Mitochondrial Oxidative Protein Folding and Biogenesis","Abstract":"CONSPECTUS: Mitochondria are fundamental intracellular organelles with key roles in important cellular processes like energy production, Fe\/S cluster biogenesis, and homeostasis of lipids and inorganic ions. Mitochondrial dysfunction is consequently linked to many human pathologies (cancer, diabetes, neurodegeneration, stroke) and apoptosis. Mitochondrial bio-genesis relies on protein import as most mitochondrial proteins (about 10-15% of the human proteome) are imported after their synthesis in the cytosol. Over the last several years many mitochondrial translocation pathways have been discovered. Among them, the import pathway that targets proteins to the intermembrane space (IMS) stands out as it is the only one that couples import to folding and oxidation and results in the covalent modification of the incoming precursor that adopt internal disulfide bonds in the process (the MIA. pathway). The discovery of this pathway represented a significant paradigm shift as it challenged the prevailing dogma that the endoplasmic reticulum is the only compartment of eukaryotic cells where oxidative folding can occur. The concept of the oxidative folding pathway was first proposed on the basis of folding and import data for the small Tim proteins that have conserved cysteine motifs and must adopt intramolecular disulfides after import so that they are retained in the organelle. The introduction of disulfides in the IMS is catalyzed by Mia40 that functions as a chaperone inducing their folding. The sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 generates the disulfide pairs de novo using either molecular oxygen or, cytochrome c and other proteins as terminal electron acceptors that eventually link this folding process to respiration. The solution NMR structure of Mia40 (and supporting biochemical experiments) showed that Mia40 is a novel type of disulfide donor whose recognition capacity for its substrates relies on a hydrophobic binding cleft found adjacent to a thiol active CPC motif. Targeting of the substrates to this pathway is guided by a novel type of IMS targeting signal called ITS or MISS. This consists of only 9 amino acids, found upstream or downstream of a unique Cys that is primed for docking to Mia40 when the substrate is accommodated in the Mia40 binding cleft. Different routes exist to complete the folding of the substrates and their final maturation in the IMS. Identification of new Mia40 substrates (some even without the requirement of their cysteines) reveals an expanded chaperone-like activity of this protein in the IMS. New evidence on the targeting of redox active proteins like thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, and peroxiredoxin into the IMS suggests the presence of redox-dependent regulatory mechanisms of the protein folding and import process in mitochondria. Maintenance of redox balance in mitochondria is crucial for normal cell physiology and depends on the cross-talk between the various redox signaling processes and the mitochondrial oxidative folding pathway.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Dual gradients of light intensity and nutrient concentration for full-factorial mapping of photosynthetic productivity","Abstract":"Optimizing bioproduct generation from microalgae is complicated by the myriad of coupled parameters affecting photosynthetic productivity.

We present a simple hydrogel-based platform for the rapid, full-factorial mapping of light and nutrient availability on the growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae. We accomplish this without microfabrication using thin sheets of cell-laden hydrogels. By immobilizing the algae in a hydrogel matrix we are able to take full advantage of the continuous spatial chemical gradient produced by a diffusion-based gradient generator while eliminating the need for chambers. We map the effect of light intensities between 0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 130 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (similar to 28 W m(-2)) coupled with ammonium concentrations between 0 mM and 7 mM on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our data set, verified with bulk experiments, clarifies the role of ammonium availability on the photosynthetic productivity Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, demonstrating the dependence of ammonium inhibition on light intensity. Specifically, a sharp optimal growth peak emerges at approximately 2 mM only for light intensities between 80 and 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) - suggesting that ammonium inhibition is insignificant at lower light intensities. We speculate that this phenomenon is due to the regulation of the high affinity ammonium transport system in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as well as free ammonia toxicity.

We demonstrate a simple and robust route to fabricate nanoparticles and then show their efficacy through imaging and drug delivery in inflammatory disease models of atherosclerosis and obesity. Self-assembled LiLa nanoparticles can be modified with a variety of hydrophobic entities such as drug cargos, signaling lipids, and imaging reporters resulting in sub-100 nm nanoparticles-with low polydispersities. The optimized theranostic LiLa formulation with gadolinium, fluorescein and \"eat-me\" phagocytic signals (Gd-FITC-LiLa) a) demonstrates high relaxivity that improves magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sensitivity, b) encapsulates hydrophobic drugs at up to 60% by weight, and c) selectively targets inflammatory M1 macrophages concomitant with controlled release of the payload of anti-inflammatory drug. The mechanism and kinetics of the payload discharge appeared to be phospholipase A2 activity-dependent, as determined by means of intracellular Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). In vivo, LiLa targets M1 macrophages in a mouse model of atherosclerosis, allowing noninvasive imaging of atherosclerotic plaque by MRI. In the context of obesity, LiLa particles were selectively deposited to M1 macrophages within inflamed adipose tissue, as demonstrated by single-photon intravital imaging in mice.

Metal embrittlement has been identified as a major consequence of hydrogen uptake and represents an extra challenge for lubricated tribological parts in fuel cell vehicles, hydrogen compressors, storage tanks, dispensers and wind turbines that are normally subjected to high stresses. This study has found WS2 nanoparticles as an effective additive candidate to impede the permeation of hydrogen into rolling element bearings at high temperatures and pressures. Compared to the pure polyalphaolefin (PAO) base oil, WS2 nanoadditized oil reduced the concentration of permeated hydrogen in the bearing steel and led to controlled wear and smoother tracks. These effects are attributed to the formation of a chemical tribofilm on the wear track which reduces hydrogen embrittlement and extends the life of steel through several mechanisms: (1) its continuous generation impedes formation of nascent catalytic surfaces during rubbing and thus prevents the decomposition of oil\/water molecules and generation of atomic hydrogen; (2) acts as a physical barrier to hydrogen permeation through the wear track; (3) the low coefficient of diffusion of hydrogen through the tungsten compounds found in the tribofilm further reduces hydrogen permeation; (4) some of the atomic hydrogen is used up in redox reactions during the formation of the tribofilm and (5) the tribofilm reduces the total amount of water in the steel formed by the reaction of hydrogen atoms with oxides and thus extends the fatigue life.

The effect of the chemical activation (using KOH) on the nanometer-scale morphology, local structure, porous texture and surface chemistry of the resulting carbon materials was investigated and correlated with their electrochemical behaviour. The electrochemical performance of the activated xerogels was studied in a three-electrode cell using 1 M H2SO4 as the electrolyte. The results underlined the relevant role played by the xerogel nanomorphology; more specifically, xerogels with cellular structures exhibiting well-connected, continuous and very thin (similar to 5-15 nm) carbon walls (prepared with lower amounts of activating agent) favored ionic diffusion and electronic conduction compared to materials with broken, thicker walls (obtained from higher amounts of activating agent). The effect of nanomorphology and local structure was also made apparent when the xerogels were used as actual supercapacitor electrodes. Particularly, a symmetric capacitor assembled from a carbon xerogel with very thin walls and relatively high graphitic character delivered a much higher specific capacitance than that of a commercial activated carbon (223 vs 153 F g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) as well as a significantly improved retention of capacitance at high current densities.

This paper provides a new kind of anode material with satisfied electrical performance for SIBs. Methods: Fe2O3-carbon composite nanofibers (FeCNFs) were synthesized through an uncomplicated and meliorable electrospinning process followed by calcination. The obtained FeCNFs were applied as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. Results: The FeCNFs SIBs show excellent performance. At a current density of 50 mA g(-1), a high reversible capacity of 606 mA h g(-1) is achieved. Moreover, an ideal reversible capacity of 167 mAh g(-1) is achieved even at a current density of 500 mA g(-1), demonstrating good rate capability of FeCNFs. Conclusion: As compared with pure carbon nanofibers (CNFs), the capacity and rate capability of FeCNFs are drastically improved due to the homogeneous dispersed Fe2O3 nanoparticles on the surface of carbon nanofibers. Such a structure prevents the aggregation of Fe2O3 nanoparticles, maintains the structure integrity and thus enhances the electrochemical performance.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"MoS2 Nanosheets Vertically Aligned on Carbon Paper: A Freestanding Electrode for Highly Reversible Sodium-Ion Batteries","Abstract":"The development of sodium-ion batteries for large-scale applications requires the synthesis of electrode materials with high capacity, high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), high rate performance, long cycle life, and low cost. A rational design of freestanding anode materials is reported for sodium-ion batteries, consisting of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets aligned vertically on carbon paper derived from paper towel. The hierarchical structure enables sufficient electrode\/electrolyte interaction and fast electron transportation. Meanwhile, the unique architecture can minimize the excessive interface between carbon and electrolyte, enabling high ICE. The as-prepared MoS2@carbon paper composites as freestanding electrodes for sodium-ion batteries can liberate the traditional electrode manufacturing procedure, thereby reducing the cost of sodium-ion batteries. The freestanding MoS2@carbon paper electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity, high ICE, good cycling performance, and excellent rate capability. By exploiting in situ Raman spectroscopy, the reversibility of the phase transition from 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2 is observed during the sodium-ion intercalation\/deintercalation process. This work is expected to inspire the development of advanced electrode materials for high-performance sodium-ion batteries.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Understanding Cellulose Dissolution: Energetics of Interactions of Ionic Liquids and Cellobiose Revealed by Solution Microcalorimetry","Abstract":"In this report, the interactions between fifteen selected ionic liquids (ILs) and cellobiose (CB) are examined by high-precision solution microcalorimetry. The heat of mixing (H-mix) of CB and ILs, or CB and IL\/molecular solvent (MS) solutions, provides the first ever-published measure of the affinity of CB with ILs. Most importantly, we found that there is a very good correlation between the nature of the results found for H-mix((CB)) and the solubility behavior of cellulose. This correlation suggests that H-mix((CB)) offers a good estimate of the enthalpy of dissolution of cellulose even in solvents in which cellulose is insoluble. Therefore, the current findings open up new horizons for unravelling the intricacies of the thermodynamic factors accounting for the spontaneity of cellulose dissolution in ILs or IL\/MS solutions.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Electron transfer amongst flavo- and hemo-proteins: diffusible species effect the relay processes, not protein-protein binding","Abstract":"Hitherto, electron transfer (ET) between redox proteins has been deemed to occur via donor-acceptor binding, and diffusible reactive species are considered as deleterious side-products in such systems. Herein, ET from cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR, an animal membrane flavoprotein) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP, a plant hemoprotein) to cytochrome c (Cyt c, a soluble animal hemoprotein) was probed under diverse conditions, using standard assays. ET in the CPR-Cyt c system was critically inhibited by cyanide and sub-equivalent levels of polar one-electron cyclers like copper ions, vitamin C\/Trolox and superoxide dismutase. In the presence of lipids, inhibition was also afforded by amphipathic molecules vitamin E, palmitoyl-vitamin C and the membrane hemoprotein, cytochrome b(5). Such nonspecific inhibition (by diverse agents in both aqueous and lipid phases) indicated that electron transfer\/relay was effected by small diffusible agents, whose lifetimes are shortened by the diverse radical scavengers. When CPR was retained in a dialysis membrane and Cyt c presented outside in free solution, ET was still observed. Further, HRP (taken at nM levels) catalyzed oxidation of a phenolic substrate was significantly inhibited upon the incorporation of sub-nM levels of Cyt c. The findings imply that CPR-Cyt c or HRP-Cyt c binding is not crucial for ET. Further, fundamental quantitative arguments (based on diffusion\/collision) challenge the erstwhile protein-protein binding-assisted ET hypothesis. It is proven beyond reasonable doubt that mobile and diffusible electron carriers (ions and radicals) serve as \"redox-relay agents\" in the biological ET models\/setup studied.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Torsional vibrations of a column of fine-grained material: A gradient elastic approach","Abstract":"The gradient theory of elasticity with damping is successfully employed to explain the experimentally observed shift in resonance frequencies during forced harmonic torsional vibration tests of columns made of fine-grained material from their theoretically computed values on the basis of the classical theory of elasticity with damping. To this end, the governing equation of torsional vibrations of a column with circular cross-section is derived both by the lattice theory and the continuum gradient elasticity theory with damping, with consideration of micro-stiffness and micro-inertia effects. Both cases of a column with two rotating masses attached at its top and bottom, and of a column fixed at its base carrying a rotating mass at its free top, are considered. The presence of both micro-stiffness and micro-inertia effects helps to explain the observed natural frequency shift to the left or to the right of the classical values depending on the nature of interparticle forces (repulsive or attractive) due to particle charge. A method for using resonance column tests to determine not only the shear modulus but also the micro-stiffness and micro-inertia coefficients of gradient elasticity for fine-grained materials is proposed.

LFP-NT exhibit a high specific capacity (similar to 165 mA h g(-1) at 1C-rate) and superior rate capability with reversible capacity of similar to 100 mA h g(-1) (similar to 60 mA h g(-1)) at a current rate of 10C (25C) with almost 100% capacity retention after 1000 cycles, whereas, LFP-NP exhibit poor capacity retention even at low C-rates (<10 mA h g(-1) at 5C-rate). Although shortened pathways for Li transport exist in both the microstructures, the key point to achieve high-rate capability in LFP system is to facilitate easy access to the entry points of 1D channels running along b-axis of olivine structure. The curved cylindrical surfaces of bamboo-like nanotubes have a large proportion of these entry points. The nanoparticles have limited access to these entry points due to agglomeration, therefore exhibiting poor capacity retention at high C-rates.

This gel system is based on two-component gelators containing a succinamic acid derivative (SAD) and a primary alkyl amine (R-NH2). With the increase of temperature to 85 degrees C, a rarely reported reversible heat-set gel (gel formation with the increase of temperature) is afforded. Upon addition of fatty acids into two-component gelators, a conventional gel (gel formation with the decrease of temperature) is formed. When the fatty acid is replaced with dicarboxylic acid, a new heat-set gel is generated, which is irreversible and thermally super-stable. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the formation of a reversible heat-set gel relies on electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. These two-component gelators show a perfect gel system for the formation of diverse gels including heat-set gels, conventional gels and irreversible heat-set gels.

The diffusion properties of the supramolecular hydrogel were conveniently tuned by adding a small amount of kappa-carrageenan (<= 1% w\/v) as a crosslinking agent.

The resulting dual source titania thin films containing different amounts of preformed crystalline species were investigated by time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements and tested in the photocatalytic conversion of 4-chlorophenol. The gradual addition of preformed nanopartides leads to a consistent increase of the mean size of titania crystalline domains, whereas the porosity of the composite is well-preserved due to the shapepersistent nature of the NCC template. Microwave conductivity studies establish increased photoconductivity of the films containing preformed anatase nanoparticles in comparison to that of films made without the nanoparticles. The synergistic features of the dual source titania, namely the improved crystalline properties brought by the preformed nanocrystals in combination with the high surface area provided by the NCC-templated sol-gel titania, result in a very high photocatalytic activity of the films in the photocatalytic decomposition of 4-chlorophenol.

The measurements were performed in the temperature range commonly used for starch modifications optimizing properties important for industrial applications. Upon thermal treatment, because of breaking of the polymer chains, diminishing of the average molecular weights occurred, which significantly influences generation of radicals, evidenced by EPR. For the relatively mild conditions, with heating parameters not exceeding temperature 230 degrees C and time of heating equal to 30 min a moderate changes of both the number of thermally generated radicals and the mean molecular weight of the starch were observed. After more drastic thermal treatment (e.g. 2 h at 230 degrees C), a rapid increase in the radical amount occurred, which was accompanied by significant reduction of the starch molecular size and crystallinity. Experimentally established threshold values of heating parameters should not be exceeded in order to avoid excessive damages of the starch structure accompanied by the formation of the redundant amount of radicals. This requirement is important for industrial applications, because significant destruction of the starch matrix might annihilate the positive influence of the previously performed intentional starch modification.

In this paper, a nonlinear, transient finite element formulation is presented for initial boundary value problems associated with swelling and deformation of hydrogels, based on a nonlinear continuum theory that is consistent with classical theory of linear poroelasticity. A mixed finite element method is implemented with implicit time integration. The incompressible or nearly incompressible behavior at the initial stage imposes a constraint to the finite element discretization in order to satisfy the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) condition for stability of the mixed method, similar to linear poroelasticity as well as incompressible elasticity and Stokes flow; failure to choose an appropriate discretization would result in locking and numerical oscillations in transient analysis. To demonstrate the numerical method, two problems of practical interests are considered: constrained swelling and flat-punch indentation of hydrogel layers. Constrained swelling may lead to instantaneous surface instability for a soft hydrogel in a good solvent, which can be regulated by assuming a stiff surface layer. Indentation relaxation of hydrogels is simulated beyond the linear regime under plane strain conditions, in comparison with two elastic limits for the instantaneous and equilibrium states. The effects of Poisson's ratio and loading rate are discussed. It is concluded that the present finite element method is robust and can be extended to study other transient phenomena in hydrogels.

Here, we use three-dimensional orchid-like TiO2 nanowires (OC-TiO2 NWs) as scaffold materials to overcome the deficiencies of TiO2 NP-based structures. The perovskite precursor deeply infiltrated into the spacious pores within the OC-TiO2 NW network and crystallized in the scaffold layer, which increased the recombination resistance and charge extraction efficiency. Additionally, Ag NPs were introduced in the form of a silica-coated Ag@OC-TiO2 NW (SiO2@Ag@OC-TiO2 NW) composite to achieve still better performance through localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and exciton dissociation inducement of the Ag NPs. Consequently, a PSC based on this collaborative scaffold consisting of Ag NPs and OC-TiO2 NWs exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.09%, which is an improvement of 24% over a PSC based on a TiO2 NP scaffold layer, where the average PCE was 12.17%.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Study of the controlled temperature reaction between c\/oso-decahydrodecaborate and alcohols in H2SO4 medium","Abstract":"The reactions of the ammonium salt of c\/oso-decahydrodecaborate (NH4)(2)B10H10 with alcohols were studied in concentrated sulfuric acid medium. Alcohols ROH (R = CH3, C2H5, C3H7, iso-C3H7, C4H9, 2-C4H9, ter-C4H9, C5H11) played the role of solvent and ligand, simultaneously. These Electrophile Induced Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions were conducted at two different temperatures (25 degrees C or reflux) in atmospheric air and produced [2-B10H900-, [2,7(8)-B10H8(0R)212- and\/or [B10H7(OR)(3)](2-). The rate of the reaction and the nature of the product formed depended on the temperature, on the alcohol, and on the reaction duration. The reactions at 25 degrees C, if proceeded, produced mainly the monoalkoxy derivative, [2-B10H900-. For the longer chain alcohols (4 carbons and above) the increase in the reaction duration and the temperature resulted in higher substitution, thus producing the dialkoxy [2,7(8)-B10H8(OR)(2)(2-) and trialkoxy [B10H7(OR)(3)](2-) derivatives. Meanwhile only the monoalkoxy [2-B10H9OR](-) plus the dialkyloxonium [2-B10H90R2] derivatives were produced with the shorter alcohols (1 to 3 carbons) at refluxing temperature. All these derivatives were isolated in their pure forms on DEAE-cellulose column with adequate yields, and characterized by B-11, C-13, H-1 NMR, negative ESI and TLC.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Flexible ribbon-shaped coaxial electrical conductive nanocable array endowed with magnetism and photoluminescence","Abstract":"A new type of flexible [Fe3O4\/polyaniline (PANI)\/PMMA]@[Tb(BA)(3)phen\/PMMA] ribbon-shaped coaxial conductive nanocable array possessing conductivity, magnetism and photoluminescence has been successfully fabricated by electrospinning technology using a specially designed coaxial spinneret.

A nonspectroscopic approach that may be directly observed could provide numerous benefits. Using chiral alanine-appended benzene-tricarboxamide gelators, we reveal a methanol gel system that is capable of providing visual discrimination between enantiomers of various diamines. Specifically, gelation is induced by supramolecular nanofiber assembly resulting from interaction between a chiral gelator and a diamine of opposing chirality (i.e., a heterochiral system). Upon further implementing the chiral gelator in electrospun fibers as solid state films, we revealed enantioselective surface wetting properties that allowed for determining chirality through contact angle measurements. While these two approaches of observable gelation and surface wetting offer nonspectroscopic approaches, we also find that the supramolecular nanofiber assembly was able to enhance the induced circular dichroism signal resulting from addition of chiral diamines, allowing precise quantification of their enantiomeric purity.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Fabrication of three-dimensional nanofibrous macrostructures by electrospinning","Abstract":"Electrospinning has been widely used in fabricating nanofibers and nanofibrous membranes.

The surface charge of curcumin nanoparticles (positive, negative and neutral), with an average diameter of 30 nm, were synthesized and characterized. Polyvinyl-alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone and dextran were used as coatings to confer negative, positive and neutral charges. The synthesized Cur-NPs were evaluated for particle size, encapsulation efficiency, surface charge, qualitative and quantitative cellular uptakes, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Positively charged nanoparticles showed higher cytotoxicity effects compared to negative and neutral particles. The same trend was observed in antioxidant activity, which included radical scavenging and nitric oxide production. In addition, the anti-inflammatory activity (interleukin-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) depleted in the order: positive > negative > neutral. The void neutral-, positively- and negatively-charged nanoparticles did not show any cytotoxic effects.

Thus, in this contribution we report the facile preparation of polymerizable ionic liquid-based gel beads using thiol-ene click chemistry. This novel system incorporates pentaerythritol tetra (3-mercaptopropionate) (PETKMP) and 1,4-di(vinylimidazolium) butane bisbromide in a thiol-ene-based photopolymerization to fabricate the gel beads. Their chemical structure, thermal and mechanical properties have been investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The gel beads possess low T-g and their ionic functionalities attribute self-healing properties and their ability to uptake small molecules or organic compounds offers their potential use as pH sensing material and macrocontainers.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Altering crystal growth and annealing in ice-templated scaffolds","Abstract":"The potential applications of ice-templating porous materials are constantly expanding, especially as scaffolds for tissue engineering. Ice-templating, a process utilizing ice nucleation and growth within an aqueous solution, consists of a cooling stage (before ice nucleation) and a freezing stage (during ice formation). While heat release during cooling can change scaffold isotropy, the freezing stage, where ice crystals grow and anneal, determines the final size of scaffold features. To investigate the path of heat flow within collagen slurries during solidification, a series of ice-templating molds were designed with varying the contact area with the heat sink, in the form of the freeze drier shelf. Contact with the heat sink was found to be critical in determining the efficiency of the release of latent heat within the perspex molds. Isotropic collagen scaffolds were produced with pores which ranged from 90 mu m up to 180 mu m as the contact area decreased. In addition, low-temperature ice annealing was observed within the structures. After 20 h at -30 A degrees C, conditions which mimic storage prior to lyophilization, scaffold architecture was observed to coarsen significantly. In future, ice-templating molds should consider not only heat conduction during the cooling phase of solidification, but the effects of heat flow during ice growth and annealing.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Chiral electronic transitions of YVO4:Eu3+ nanoparticles in cellulose based photonic materials with circularly polarized excitation","Abstract":"A novel chiral nematic luminescent film is fabricated by incorporating YVO4:Eu3+ nanoparticles with cellulose nanocrystals.

Liposomes are therefore often used as models for biomembranes and as drug delivery carriers. However, materials encapsulated within liposomes often cannot respond to changes in the external environment. The ability of enclosed materials to maintain their responsiveness to changes in the external environment following encapsulation into liposomes would greatly expand the applicability of such systems. We hypothesize that embedding pore-like \"access points\" into the liposomal membrane could allow for the transmission of information between the internal and external liposomal environments and thus overcome this inherent limitation of conventional liposomes. To investigate this, we evaluated whether a change in the pH of an external solution could be transmitted to the inside of liposomes through the pore forming protein, yeast voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). Transmission of a pH change via VDAC was evaluated using a polyglutamic acid\/doxorubicin complex (PGA\/Dox) as an internal pH sensor. Upon encapsulation into conventional liposomes, PGA\/Dox exhibits no pH sensitivity due to isolation from the external environment. On the other hand, PGA\/Dox was found to retain its pH sensitivity upon encapsulation into VDAC-reconstituted liposomes, suggesting that VDAC facilitated the transmission of information on the pH of the external environment to the inside of the liposomes. In conclusion, we successfully demonstrated the transmission of information between the external and internal liposomal environments by a stable pore like structure embedded into the liposomal membranes, which serve as access points.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Crystal Structure of the Glycophorin A Transmembrane Dimer in Lipidic Cubic Phase","Abstract":"The mechanisms of assembly and function for many important type I\/II (single-pass) transmembrane (TM) receptors are proposed to involve the formation and\/or alteration of specific interfaces among their membrane-embedded alpha-helical TM domains. The application of lipidic cubic phase (LCP) bilayer media for crystallization of single-alpha-helical TM complexes has the potential to provide valuable structural and mechanistic insights into many such systems. However, the fidelity of the interfaces observed in crowded crystalline arrays has been difficult to establish from the very limited number of such structures determined using X-ray diffraction data. Here we examine this issue using the glycophorin A (GpA) model system; whose homodimeric TM helix interface has been characterized by solution and solid-state NMR and biochemical techniques but never crystallographically. We report that a GpA-TM peptide readily crystallized in a mono olein cubit phase bilayer, yielding a dimeric alpha-helical structure that is in excellent agreement with previously reported NMR measurements made in several different types of host media. These results provide compelling support for the wider application of LCP techniques to enable X-ray crystallographic analysis of single-pass TM interactions.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Nd doping of bismuth ferrite to tune electromagnetic properties and increase microwave absorption by magnetic-dielectric synergy","Abstract":"Simultaneously achieving tunable electromagnetic parameters and strong absorption capacity in a single material is still a great challenge. Here, we present Nd doped BiFeO3 with electromagnetic matching, which exhibits tunable electromagnetic properties and high-performance microwave absorption. The experimental and calculated results demonstrate that Nd doping generates the ordered domain structure and changes the coupling states of electrons, which induce difficult polarization rotation and strong natural ferromagnetic resonance, leading to the decrease of dielectric loss and the increase of magnetic loss with increasing Nd concentration. The electromagnetic parameters are tuned from mismatching to matching, and the microwave absorption is improved. Bi0.8Nd0.2FeO3 exhibits a remarkable reflection loss (RL) of -42 dB and bandwidth (RL <= -10 dB) which covers nearly three quarters of the X-band at a thickness from 1.9 to 2.1 mm.

Herein, we demonstrated that increasing rigidness of carbon coating by incorporating the analogue of Al oxide was able to improve the rate capability and cycling stability of Co3O4. Compared with carbon coating, a hybrid coating consisted of carbon and the analogue of Al oxide (COAl) showed increased rigidness and robustness, which can suppress the massive expansion of Co3O4 upon lithiation, and accordingly, a conductive linkage of carbon over the electrode surface could be well preserved by using a thin hybrid coating. In this way, good electrode integration was obtained together with fast electric conduction and short Li+ diffusion distance. AFM force curve, SEM observation and impedance measurement were carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of our strategy. During the tests of Li-ion batteries, C@Co3O4@COAl exhibited significantly improved rate capability (0.2-20 A g(-1)) and cycling stability (4000 cycles at 5 A g(-1)) as compared with C@Co3O4@C, thus manifesting the significant role by increasing the rigidness of carbon coating.

The present prospect represents a similar progress in the field of thermoplastic material and focuses on the burgeoning field of heat sinking materials and hydrophobicity. Nanoscale coalescence of Nano Fumed Silica (NFS) filler in a polycarbonate (PC) matrix is ameliorated by two different techniques viz. solvent casting and spray coating. The spray-coating technique was reconnoitred by numerical modelling parameters. The characteristic peak appears at 1094 cm(-1) and 3821 cm(-1) in the FTIR which corroborate the interaction between PC and NFS. PC\/NFS solution with workable viscosity 25 cP exemplifies homogeneous dispersion in the PC matrix ascertained by FESEM with utmost loading of 10 wt% NFS. An 85% increment in contact angle was observed which justified with accretion in surface roughness (12.5 nm) of the composite as well as from the Cassie-Baxter model. Effective thermal conductivity of the composite was mathematically computed with 46% decrement as compared to a pristine PC counterpart, which is in agreement with the TGA results as char residue is enhanced from 22% to 49%. The results affirm that the spray-coated samples give more efficacy in terms of heat sinking capacity and hydrophobic characteristics as compared to solvent-casted films and justifies its competency to replace conventional thermoplastic composites.

The material beta-CD\/Cs-MGO combined with beta-cyclodextrin, chitosan and graphene oxide was used to provide multiple imprinting sites and a large surface area was characterized by SEM, XRD and FTIR. It was found that beta-CD\/Cs-MGO-SMIP followed the Langmuir isotherm equation and pseudo-second order sorption kinetics when binding the template. This material demonstrated fast mass transfer, a promoted rate of removal of the biomacromolecule and excellent recognition and adsorption ability for the imprinting cavities situated at the surface of beta-CD\/Cs-MGO, which enabled easy access to BSA. Subsequently, a highly sensitive CL biosensor for BSA was proposed based on the strong recognition effect between beta-CD\/Cs-MGO-SMIP and BSA which led to a high selectivity of the sensor, and the proposed biosensor could assay in the range 5.0 x 10(-7) to 1.0 x 10(-4) mg mL(-1) with a detection limit of 1.1 x 10(-7) mg mL(-1).

PTA@MIL-101(Fe)-NH2-Cl can only be obtained in DMF because of its excellent ability to deprotonate the organic ligands and promotion to yield MIL-101 crystals by forming a Cl-H-DMF complex. The water-containing solvents were unfavorable to yield MIL-101 crystals since MIL-101 crystals reorganized and other crystals were formed in this kind of solvents. The metal cation concentration kinetically controlled the crystal structure. MIL-101 crystals were fabricated only at low metal cation concentration. In the DMF synthesis system, the supported phosphotungstic acid (PTA) retained its Keggin structure. The acidity dramatically decreased compared to PTA caused by the double electrostatic interaction of amino groups and positively charged exterior surface of carrier MIL-101(Fe)-NH2-Cl.

However, for materials such as paper to replace materials with a higher ecological footprint, they need to be strong, ductile, provide a gas barrier, and, sometimes, also be transparent. Improved properties, or even novel properties, are also important for use outside the conventional markets. This paper describes how cellulose fibres partly derivatised to dialcohol cellulose can be used to fabricate high-density materials by conventional papermaking techniques that simultaneously display all the above-mentioned features. The materials produced were characterised with respect to X-ray diffraction, dynamic mechanical thermal behaviour, visual appearance, oxygen permeability and tensile properties. The highest degree of modification studied, resulted in a material with thermoplastic features, a tensile strength of 57 MPa, a strain-at break of 44% and an oxygen permeability at 80% RH of 23 ml mu m (m(2) kPa 24 h)(-1). At a thickness of 125 mu m, these films have a total light transmittance of 78% (87% haze). However, by hot pressing the film for 2 min at 150 degrees C under a pressure of 16 MPa, and thereby increasing the density, the total transmittance increases to 89% (23% haze). The hot pressing can also be used to fuse individual pieces together, which is useful in many modern packaging applications. Altogether, this work shows how chemical modification of cellulose fibres can be used to induce novel properties and improve the range of application, and consequently provide an interesting bio-based material with a good potential to replace less sustainable materials.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"MnFe2O4-Fe3O4 core-shell nanoparticles as a potential contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging","Abstract":"In recent years, magnetic core-shell nanoparticles have received widespread attention due to their unique properties that can be used for various applications. We introduce here a magnetic core-shell nanoparticle system for potential application as a contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MnFe2O4-Fe3O4 core-shell nanoparticles were synthesized by the wet-chemical synthesis method. Detailed structural and compositional charaterization confirmed the formation of a core-shell microstructure for the nanoparticles. Magnetic charaterization revealed the superparamagnetic nature of the as-synthesized core-shell nanoparticles. Average size and saturation magnetization values obtained for the as-synthesized core-shell nanoparticle were 12.5 nm and 69.34 emu g(-1) respectively. The transverse relaxivity value of the water protons obtained in the presence of the core-shell nanoparticles was 184.1 mM(-1) s(-1). To investigate the effect of the core-shell geometry towards enhancing the relaxivity value, transverse relaxivity values were also obtained in the presence of separately synthesized single phase Fe3O4 and MnFe2O4 nanoparticles. Average size and saturation magnetization values for the as-synthesized Fe3O4 nanoparticles were 12 nm and 65.8 emu g(-1) respectively. Average size and saturation magnetization values for the MnFe2O4 nanoparticles were 9 nm and 61.5 emu g(-1) respectively. The transverse relaxivity value obtained in the presence of single phase Fe3O4 and MnFe2O4 nanoparticles was 96.6 and 83.2 mM(-1) s(-1) respectively. All the nanoparticles (core-shell and single phase) were coated with chitosan by a surfactant exchange reaction before determining the relaxivity values. For similar nanoparticle sizes and saturation magnetization values, the highest value of the transverse relaxivity in the case of core-shell nanoparticles clearly illustrated that the difference in the magnetic nature of the core and shell phases in the core-shell nanoparticles creates greater magnetic inhomogeneity in the surrounding medium yielding a high value for proton relaxivity. The MnFe2O4-Fe3O4 core-shell nanoparticles exhibited extremely low toxicity towards the MCF-7 cell line. Taken together, this opens up new avenues for the use of core-shell nanoparticles in MRI.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification using a polypyrrole\/microbial cellulose electrode in a membraneless bio-electrochemical system","Abstract":"In this study, the feasibility of ammonium and total nitrogen (TN) removal from aqueous solution using a simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process was studied in a membraneless (single chamber) bio-electrochemical system with a novel electrode.

Routinely employed in the organization and assembly of materials in vitro, however, they have rarely been exploited in vivo, due to the concerns for enzymatic degradation and cross-hybridization with the host's genetic materials. Herein we report the development of a tight-binding, orthogonal, synthetically versatile, and informationally interfaced nucleic acid platform for programming molecular interactions, with implications for in vivo molecular assembly and computing. The system consists of three molecular entities: the right-handed and left-handed conformers and a nonhelical domain. The first two are orthogonal to each other in recognition, while the third is capable of binding to both, providing a means for interfacing the two conformers as well as the natural nucleic acid biopolymers (i.e., DNA and RNA). The three molecular entities are prepared from the same monomeric chemical scaffold, with the exception of the stereochemistry or lack thereof at the gamma-backbone that determines if the corresponding oligo adopts a right-handed or left-handed helix, or a nonhelical motif. These conformers hybridize to affinity, sequence selectivity, and level of orthogonality.

The Ni3N\/Ni-foam exhibits extremely low overpotential (similar to 50 mV), high current density and excellent stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. In addition, the modified foam demonstrates enhanced activity in the oxygen evolution (OER) and reduction (ORR) reaction compared to original Ni-foam. The activity enhancement can be attributed to the facile formation of a Ni(OH)(2) layer on the nitride layer due to improved lattice matching. The formation of the Ni3N\/Ni(OH)(2) catalyst results in lower overpotentials due to easier water dissociation on the nickel hydroxide layer. In addition, the HER is further improved due to stronger adsorption of hydrogen to the metal nitride than to the pure metal. We believe that the utilization of nickel nitride as an electrocatalyst opens opportunities for energy-related devices such as batteries and fuel cells.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Enhanced Cathodic Oxygen Reduction and Power Production of Microbial Fuel Cell Based on Noble-Metal-Free Electrocatalyst Derived from Metal-Organic Frameworks","Abstract":"Microbial fuel cell (MFC) can generate electricity from organic substances based on anodic electrochemically active microorganisms and cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), thus exhibiting promising potential for harvesting electric energy from organic wastewater.

We report in this work how terminal amino acid modifications to G(IIKK)(3)I-NH2 influence its alpha-helical structure, membrane penetrating ability, and selective actions against different cell types. Deletion of an N-terminal Gly or a C-terminal Ile did not affect their antibacterial activity much, an observation consistent with their binding behavior to negatively charged membrane lipid monolayers. However, the cytotoxicity against mammalian cells was much worsened by the N-terminal Gly deletion, consistent with an increase in its helical content. Despite little impact on the antibacterial activity of G(IIKK)(3)I-NH2, deletion of both terminal amino acids greatly reduced its antitumor activity. Cholesterol present in tumor cell membrane-mimic was thought to constrain (IIKK)(3)-NH2 from penetrating into the cancerous membranes, evident from its lowest surface physical activity at penetrating model lipid membranes. On the other hand, its low toxicity to normal mammalian cells and high antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo made it an attractive antibacterial agent. Thus, terminal modifications can help rebalance the different interactions involved and are highly effective at manipulating their selective membrane responses.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Germanium encapsulated in sulfur and nitrogen co-doped 3D porous carbon as an ultra-long-cycle life anode for lithium ion batteries","Abstract":"Germanium (Ge) has been considered as a promising anode material for Li-ion batteries because of its theoretical capacity (1600 mA h g(-1)).

In the present work, we studied for the first time in detail the influence of butanol isomers on the non-catalyzed cellulose liquefaction and the acid catalyzed formation of butyl levulinates from cellulose. In the absence of catalysts there was no influence of the alcohol class on liquefaction which reached 70-85% after 2 hours at 300 degrees C. In the presence of catalysts, we showed that the class of the alcohol had a significant influence on the butyl levulinate yield. With primary alcohols yields of 50% were obtained in the presence of H2SO4 (200 degrees C, 30 min). This level of yield can be considered as very interesting for these kinds of one-pot transformations involving cellulose. With secondary alcohols, yields less than 20% were obtained while no butyl levulinate was formed with tertiary alcohols. We also report for the first time this transformation in the presence of solid acids. Insoluble Cs2HPW12O40 or sulfated zirconia catalyzed the reaction heterogeneously despite deactivation leading to limited yields of 13% (200 degrees C, 1 hour). We finally show that water in butanol had an ambivalent role in enhancing the cellulose reactivity but limiting the esterification step and found that 5-7 wt%\/butanol of water was the optimum amount.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Enhanced acetone sensing properties of Co3O4 nanosheets with highly exposed (111) planes","Abstract":"Co3O4 nanosheets (NS-Co3O4), nanorods (NR-Co3O4), and nanofibers (NF-Co3O4) were fabricated via hydrothermal and electrospinning methods, respectively. Single crystal sheet-like Co3O4 was mainly exposed of (111) planes with a specific surface area of 39.2 m(2)\/g, while NR-Co3O4 and NF-Co3O4 were polycrystalline with specific surface areas of 53.1 and 67.1 m(2)\/g, respectively. Gas sensing response (R (g) \/R (a) ) of NS-Co3O4 to 100 ppm acetone was similar to 6.1 at 160 A degrees C, which was much higher than those of NR-Co3O4 (similar to 4.0), NF-Co3O4 (similar to 2.7) and other reported Co3O4 nanostructures. The response and recovery time of NS-Co3O4 to 100 ppm acetone were 98 and 7 s, respectively. NS-Co3O4 had the smallest specific surface area, but exhibited the best acetone sensing properties, which was possibly due to their high exposure of (111) planes. There were only Co2+ cations on (111) planes, which contained a lot of dangling bonds. Oxygen species in air could be adsorbed more easily on (111) planes than other randomly exposed planes. Thus, thicker holes accumulation layer formed and better gas sensing properties were obtained. This study has provided a basic understanding of the relationship between Co3O4 nanocrystals with exposed certain planes and their gas sensing properties.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Nano-engineered Biomaterials for Tissue Regeneration: what Has Been Achieved So Far?","Abstract":"Nanomaterials have attracted the interest of tissue engineers for the last two decades.

The technique was based on catanionic assemblies of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and sodium dodecyl sulphate surfactants as a new green extraction solvent for use in a dispersive microextraction method coupled with electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. This technique benefits from the safe and green properties of the supramolecular aggregates rather than the hazardous and volatile organic solvents commonly used in liquid-liquid microextraction methods. The main component of the dispersive solvent is water and a direct interaction between the extraction solvent and the analyte is possible. The separation behaviour of the sodium dodecyl sulphate\/cetyltrimethylammonium bromide solvent phase and various parameters influencing the extraction efficiency of lead (e.g. pH, salt concentration, centrifugation time, amount of ligand and extraction solvent) were investigated and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, linearity was observed in the range 0.1-2.0 ng mL(-1) lead with a correlation coefficient of 0.996 and a limit of detection (S\/N = 3) of 0.047 ng mL(-1). The relative standard deviations were 6.5 and 5.2% for five repeated measurements of 0.4 and 1.0 ng mL(-1) lead solutions, respectively. The effects of some common anions and cations on the lead signal were investigated. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of lead in sea water and some food samples. The accuracy of the method was confirmed by analysing a certified reference material.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Mechanism of Divalent-Ion-Induced Charge Inversion of Bacterial Membranes","Abstract":"The surface charge inversion (CI), critical for functions of many biological nanomachinery, is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which the net charge of a strongly charged surface bound with many counterions changes its sign. Many phenomena of CI cannot be explained in the framework of mean-field theories, such as linear Debye-Huckel and nonlinear Poisson Boltzmann, and is so far best described by the strongly correlated liquid (SCL) theory for multivalent (Z >= 3) ions. However, the potential CI by divalent ions, which are more relevant in the biological environment, is much less studied and remains mostly illusive. In this study, we examine the divalent-ion-induced CI of a negatively charged bacterium's cell membrane and reveal its underlying mechanism, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation theory. Our simulation results are compared with theoretical predications from SCL, and noticeable discrepancies with SCL theory, originating from the fluidity of membrane lipids whose negatively charged PO4- groups aggregate around adsorbed Ca2+, are found. Our simulation data suggest that the CI of the bacterial membrane results from the strong binding of Ca2+ to the membrane's phosphate groups via an induced-fit mechanism, forming positively charged Ca2+-centered clusters that replace originally negatively charged lipids.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"High-capacity zinc-ion storage in an open-tunnel oxide for aqueous and nonaqueous Zn-ion batteries","Abstract":"Zinc-based rechargeable batteries with two-electron transfer are promising for large-scale energy storage systems.

The effect of Ga-substitution was studied by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Initial precipitates were amorphous (minor bayerite). After hydrothermal treatment, XRD showed broad reflections at low Ga-substation indicating low crystallinity and formation of pseudoboehmite. This was confirmed by high-resolution XPS of Al 2p, Ga 2p, and O 1s. The Al 2p binding energy of 74.03 eV was closer to boehmite than pseudoboehmite, probably caused by the Ga-substitution in the structure. The O 1s showed the presence of O, OH, and H2O. The ratio of (total O)\/(Al + Ga) showed an excess of O as expected for pseudoboehmite. The ratio of (O + OH)\/Al + Ga) was also slightly larger than the theoretical value of 2 for boehmite. High concentrations of added Ga (10, 20 %) resulted in amorphous material after hydrothermal treatment.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Solvent-free thermocuring electrospinning to fabricate ultrathin polyurethane fibers with high conductivity by in situ polymerization of polyaniline","Abstract":"A new solvent-free thermal assisted electrospinning (e-spinning) process for the preparation of polyurethane (PU) microfibers has been developed. Based on the synthetic process of conventional PU, the synthesis of the PU precursor solution in this work was improved for the solventless e-spinning process. Low molecular weight (low-Mw) polyol (PTMG-500) was employed for preparing the prepolymer, and another low-Mw polyol (PEG-400) was used as the chain extender. During the chain extension, e-spinning was conducted and assisted by thermal radiation (similar to 50 degrees C), and PU microfibers with an average diameter of 25-60 mmwere fabricated. The spinnable viscosity range in this e-spinning process was 1000-2500 dPa s. In addition, 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl) propionic acid (DMPA) was introduced into the precursor solution to partially take the place of the chain extender (PEG-400), and thus the hydrophilicity of the as-spun fibrous mat was improved, which was helpful for in situ polymerization of polyaniline (PANi) on the fibers' surface to obtain conductive PU\/PANi composite fibers.

The development of an electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at reduced overpotential is thus essential. Here, we suggest a binder- free electrode based on Co nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanofibers (Co-CNFs), which simultaneously reduces the charge and discharge polarization and extends cycling stability. Co-CNF gives rise to a lower discharge polarization because of an enhanced oxygen reduction reaction activity compared to Co-free CNF. Although the embedment of Co does not enhance the OER activity, it significantly reduces charge overvoltage by forming easily decomposable amorphous Li2O2. A mechanism for the formation of amorphous Li2O2 is suggested in terms of charge localization induced by the Co NPs. The findings suggest a new electrode design strategy of combining inexpensive metals and carbon materials for modulating the phase of the discharge product.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Three-dimensional plasmonic hydrogel architecture: facile synthesis and its macroscale effective space","Abstract":"A three dimensional (3D) hydrogel SERS substrate decorated with Ag nanoparticles (NPs) was fabricated by in situ reduction of Ag+ ions in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) network.

Due to its good light penetration, a macro effective space with a depth of more than one hundred micrometres in this translucent 3D network was confirmed by slice observation and depth scanning techniques. Such macro effective space may come from harvesting plasmonic effects between active Ag NP couplings in all of the x, y, and z directions, resulting in a great average field within the whole substrate region. Due to its large effective depth, the 3D hydrogel is more sensitive and more tolerant toward an out-of-focus laser position in trace detection of the sample.

The compositional and structural design ensures dynamicity of the polymer networks as well as effective interdiffusion and interaction of dangling chains on the damaged surface in water. More importantly, the boronic ester bonds become not easily hydrolyzed at lower pH due to the electron attracting effect of quaternary ammonium cations from catechol-B3+ bonds. Qualitative visual inspection and quantitative tensile tests demonstrate that the proposed idea works, and the target polymer is allowed to be self-healed and reprocessed in waters at pH 7 and 9 at room temperature. Reshuffling and rearrangement of the polymer networks via dynamic reversible coordination of catechol-B3+ bonds helps to re-bond the interface. The technical route provides an effective solution to stabilizing catechol-B3+ bonds at lower pH, and obviously reduces the pH sensitivity of boronic ester bonds, which is the objective of the current work. As a result, the adaptivity and serviceable range of the underwater intrinsic self-healing polymer are expanded.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Direct-writing of circuit interconnects on cellulose paper using ultra-long, silver nanowires based conducting ink","Abstract":"A highly stable conducting nanoink based on silver ultra-long nanowires (Ag ULNWs) was developed by a self-seeding polyol method with controlled doping of silver acetate for flexible electronics applications.

Despite important advances on the impact of organic compounds on iron biogeochemistry, their roles in controlling iron availability to prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton remain unclear. Whether algal and bacterial exopolymeric substances (EPS) include organic ligands which may help iron-limited phytoplankton growth remains an unknown. If so, then EPS could relieve phytoplankton iron limitation with implications for the biological carbon pump and hence the regulation of atmospheric CO2. Here we compared the biological impact of algal, bacterial and in situ EPS with model compounds, a siderophore and two saccharides on biological parameters including, iron bioavailability, phytoplankton growth, photo-physiology and community structure. Laboratory and field experiments demonstrated that EPS produced by marine microorganisms are efficient in sustaining biological iron uptake as well as algal growth, and can affect natural phytoplankton community structure. Our data suggest that natural phytoplankton growth enhancement in the presence of EPS was not solely due to highly bioavailable iron forms, but also because EPS contains other micronutrients. Stronger ligands were detected following iron-siderophore enrichments (log K-Fe'L = 12.0) and weaker ligands were measured in the presence of EPS (log K-Fe'L = 10.4-11.0). The trend of the conditional stability constants of organic ligands did not seem to be affected as a result of biological activity and photo-chemistry during our four day incubations. The shift in the phytoplankton community observed during our field experiments was not uniformly observed between different sites rendering it difficult to extrapolate which functional group(s) would benefit the most from iron bound to EPS.

Free energy profiles for the insertion of each amino acid into the lipid bilayer were computed along an appropriated reaction coordinate. The simulation results for glycine in the presence of DPPC were compared with experimental data obtained by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Experimental results predict, in good agreement with simulations, the existence of intermolecular interactions between the DPPC head groups and glycine. Atomistic simulations were further extended to investigate the free energy profiles for lysine, proline and histidine, leading to the following conclusions: (i) lysine free energy profiles computed using a united atom force-field and an analog molecule, where the side-chain is truncated at the beta-carbon atom, differ significantly from each other; (ii) the free energy profiles for the three forms of histidine are all very similar, although the charged form interacts mostly with the carbonyl groups of DPPC, while the tautomers interact with the phosphate groups; and (iii) proline does not show a minimum in the free energy profile, pointing to the absence of binding to the membrane lipids.

UGGT transfers a glucose residue to a glycoprotein containing Man(9)GlcNAc(2) (M9; Man=mannose, GlcNAc=N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) N-glycan only when the glycoprotein has not attained a native form. We chemically prepared homogeneous glycoproteins containing M9 N-glycan in the native form as well as in misfolded forms and examined them as substrates of UGGT. Glucose transfer to misfolded glycoproteins was clearly observed by LC-MS, but glycoproteins in the native form were barely glucosylated. Furthermore, we constructed an in vitro glycoprotein folding system in the presence of UGGT and found out that all folding intermediates which appeared during folding were also glucosylated.

The nZVI particles were synthesized under a nitrogen atmosphere by reducing Fe(III) cations with sodium borohydride NaBH4 in the presence of an AN\/MA\/IA membrane as a supporting scaffold. The synthesized nZVI particles are uniformly distributed into the membrane with a mean diameter ranging from 70 to 100 nm. The AN\/MA\/IA\/nZVI membrane was characterized using SEM-EDX, XRD, XPS, TGA, ATR-FTIR, field dependent magnetization measurements using a super conducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer and Mossbauer spectroscopy. XRD analysis, Mossbauer spectroscopy and magnetization measurements confirmed the presence of the nZVI supported AN\/MA\/IA membrane, but XPS analysis showed that the surface of the nZVI particles oxidized to iron oxide forms, suggesting a core shell structure of nZVI on the membrane. We show that the composite AN\/MA\/IA\/nZVI membrane can effectively remove As(III) and As(V) from water with a sorption capacity of 46.7 mg g(-1) and 46.4 mg g(-1) for As(III) and As(V), respectively. Inner-sphere surface complexation, oxidation and reduction reaction, ion exchange, electrostatic repulsion and functional group interaction are discussed as the major mechanisms involved in the arsenic removal by the functionalized membrane. The repeated cycles of adsorption\/ desorption and regeneration using 0.1 M NaOH signifies the AN\/MA\/IA\/nZVI membrane as an efficient material for the removal of arsenic contamination from water.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Actuation of shape-memory colloidal fibres of Janus ellipsoids","Abstract":"Many natural micrometre-scale assemblies can be actuated to control their optical, transport and mechanical properties, yet such functionality is lacking in colloidal structures synthesized thus far.

In this study, the collection and inactivation of Escherichia coli K12 was examined using cellulose nanofiber mats that were surface-functionalized using three polyelectrolytes: poly (acrylic acid) (PAA), chitosan (CS), and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (pDADMAC). The polyelectrolyte functionalized nanofiber mats retained the cylindrical morphology and average fiber diameter (-0.84 1.1.m) of the underlying cellulose nanofibers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurements confirmed the presence of polycations or polyanions on the surface of the nanofiber mats. Both the control cellulose and pDADMAC-functionalized nanofiber mats exhibited a high collection of E. coli K12, which suggests that mat hydrophilicity may play a larger role than surface charge on cell collection. While the minimum concentration of polycations needed to inhibit E. coli K12 was 800 1.1.g\/mL for both CS and pDADMAC, once immobilized, pDADMAC-functionalized nanofiber mats exhibited a higher inactivation of E. coli K12, (-97%).

This process includes the administration of the therapeutic product, the release of the active ingredients by the product, and the subsequent transport of the active ingredients across the biological membranes to the site of action. Drug delivery systems aim to improve patient compliance and convenience, such as, for example, fast-dissolving tablets. One of the most important goals of pharmaceutical science is localizing the pharmacological activity of the drug at the site of action. Drug delivery systems are molecular tools which, without undesired interactions at other sites, target a specific drug receptor. Keeping in view the advantages of the delivery system, rapidly disintegrating dosage forms have been successfully commercialized, and, because of increased patient demand, these dosage forms are expected to become more popular. Modern drug delivery technology has been made possible by advances in polymer science. These advances have resulted in polymers with unique properties. Drug delivery systems are made from a variety of organic and inorganic compounds such as polymers, lipids (liposomes, nanoemulsions, and solid-lipid nanoparticles), self-assembling amphiphilic molecules, dendrimers, and inorganic nanocrystals.

The detection signal was improved by addition of enhancers (HAuCl4 and NH2OH center dot HCl) to the nitrocellulose membrane of a conventional immunochromatographic strip. The detection sensitivities of the test strip before and after signal amplification were 4 x 10(4) and 5 x 10(3) CFU mL(-1), respectively, as determined by a colloidal gold strip reader. An 8-fold increase in sensitivity after signal amplification was accomplished within 20 min. No cross-reactivity with 27 non-target strains was observed, and the time for detecting E. coli O157:H7 in spiked milk samples was shortened by 1.5 h.

The SPA4 peptide suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation (JPET 2011, Innate Immun 2013). In this report, we examined the structure of synthetic SPA4 peptide in solution by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The CD analysis revealed that the SPA4 peptide is composed of similar to 35% beta sheet and <5% alpha helix. We used solution NMR to solve the structure of the SPA4 peptide. We calculated NMR structures using Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement (NOE) distance restraints. The superposition of the low energy structures indicated that the central 6-14 amino acids \"SDGTPVNYT\" of the 20-mer SPA4 peptide form a turn, and amino acids on either side (GDFRY and NWYRGE) conform to flexible arms. Furthermore, thermal denaturation experiments demonstrated the structural flexibility of the peptide.

The pore engineering and the interlaced network structure are believed to be responsible for the excellent lithium storage performance. The pore structure allows for easy diffusion of electrolyte, shortens the pathway of Li+ transport, and alleviates large volume variation during repeated Li+ extraction\/insertion. Moreover, the interlaced network structure can provide continuous electron\/ion pathways and effectively accommodate the strain induced by the volume change during the electrochemical reaction, thus maintaining structural stability and mechanical integrity of electrode materials during lithiation\/delithiation process.

By controlling electrospinning conditions carefully, the incorporated zeolites in EVOH were found to correspond closely to the feed ratios. Elemental mapping images of Si show that zeolites were uniformly blended within the fibers. The fabricated composite fibers successfully adsorbed creatinine from solution and the adsorption capacity reached a maximum at 12 h. The crystallinity of the nanofiber was also controlled by varying the composition of ethylene content in EVOH. Less crystallinity resulted in higher creatinine adsorption capacity due to the barrier property of EVOH. Cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that the composite fibers showed less toxicity than free zeolite particles which killed more than 95% of cells. The proposed composite fibers, therefore, have the potential to be utilized as a new approach to removing creatinine selectively from the bloodstream.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Electrospun porous hierarchical carbon nanofibers with tailored structures for supercapacitors and capacitive deionization","Abstract":"Hierarchical porous carbons, which contain micropores combined with mesopores and\/or macropores, promote mass transport through the macropores\/mesopores and increase the accessibility of smaller pores compared with single-sized porous carbons.

FeS2 microspheres with a high tap density of 2.2 g cm(-3) show the stable discharge capacities of 680 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and 412 mA h g(-1) even at 6000 mA g(-1). Moreover, the capacity retention is 90% after 100 cycles at 1000 mA g(-1). The main reason for the long cycling is to inhibit the side reaction of the intermediate polysulfides with electrolytes.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Intercalation-mediated nucleic acid nanoparticles for siRNA delivery","Abstract":"Tremendous effort has been made to improve stability and delivery efficacy of small RNA therapeutics.

In this study we demonstrated a feasible approach to produce antimicrobial electrospun mats through a postfabrication binding of graphene-based nanocomposites to the nanofibers' surface. A mixture of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and chitosan was electrospun to yield cylindrical and narrow-diameter (356 nm) polymeric fibers. To achieve a robust antimicrobial property, the PLGA chitosan mats were functionalized with graphene oxide decorated with silver nanopartides (GO-Ag) via a chemical reaction between the carboxyl groups of graphene and the primary amine functional groups on the PLGA chitosan fibers using 3-(dimethylamino)propyl-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide as cross-linking agents. The attachment of GO-Ag sheets to the surface of PLGA chitosan fibers was successfully revealed by scanning and transmission electron images. Upon direct contact with bacterial cells, the PLGA chitosan mats functionalized with GO-Ag nanocomposites were able to effectively inactivate both Gram-negative (Escherichia coil and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. Our results suggest that covalent binding of GO-Ag nanocomposites to the surface of PLGA-chitosan mats opens up new opportunities for the production of cost-effective, scalable, and biodegradable coating materials with the ability to hinder microbial proliferation on solid surfaces.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Is the conductive agent useful in electrodes of graphitized activated carbon?","Abstract":"In the making process of supercapacitors, the conductive agent carbon black is used for improving the conductivity of the electrodes and decreasing the resistance of interaction.

Effective drug delivery to the eye is a challenging proposition for the pharmaceutical scientist. Eye drops have been globally accepted as a formulation for anterior segment applications. On one hand it is widely used owing to its convenience but is also associated with some limitations in terms of desired pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile, dosing frequency, systemic untoward effects, patient noncompliance, low drug bioavailability due to transient contact time, rapid washout by tearing and nasolacrimal drainage. The need to overcome these major issues related to ocular pharmacotherapy has been long recognized. Several novel nanocarriers including nanolipid based carrier systems have been widely explored and investigated for ophthalmic applications. These include solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), liposomes, in situ gels, niosomes, mucoadhesive systems and discomes. Since lipids have similar structure to human cell lipids, their biodegradable, non-toxic and biocompatible profile are particularly useful. Additionally, they also offer protection against drug degradation, impart controlled drug release characteristics and site specific delivery. This review explores the potential feasibility of lipid component in formulation of nanomedicine for ophthalmic delivery and reports the clinical findings in order to improve the ocular pharmacotherapy. Here, we also discussed for patents related to the topic.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Dissolved iron(II) ligands in river and estuarine water","Abstract":"We present the first evidence of Fe(II) complexation by natural organic ligands in estuarine waters. Across five diverse river\/estuary systems we find evidence of terrestrially derived ligands with binding constants (log K-Fe(II)L) mainly in the range 6-8. These Fe(II) ligands were stable over short time periods (1-2 days), generally equivalent to, or in excess of, ambient freshwater Fe(II) concentrations (which ranged from 12 to 3600 nM) and had similar binding constants to ligands that were leached by water from vegetation and detritus (log K-Fe(II)L 7-8). A class of terrestrially derived ligands may therefore be important in stabilising Fe(II) concentrations in freshwater systems. However, in coastal seawater the impact of these ligands upon Fe(II) speciation is likely to be diminished due to a combination of dilution, loss of humic material during flocculation and increased ionic strength. The temperate and sub-tropical river systems studied included the Beaulieu (England), Itchen (England), Cape Fear (North Carolina, USA), Winyah Bay (South Carolina, USA) and Loch Etive (Scotland). Freshwaters in each system possessed a broad range of dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 200-1300 mu M), labile dissolved Fe (LDFe, Fe < 0.2 mu m available to ferrozine after reduction with ascorbic acid, 100 nM-20 mu M) and pH (5.5-8.5). In the Itchen estuary, where anthropogenic discharge constitutes >10% of freshwater input, ligand binding constants were elevated (up to log K-Fe(II)L 11) and the expected decrease in LDFe with increasing salinity along the estuary was not observed (LDFe and DOC both peaked at a salinity of 7) due to effluent inputs.

The results of GPC indicated that the average molecular weight of the bioflocculant was 3.47 x 10(5). A maximum flocculating activity of 98.27% was achieved using an optimized culture medium, identified by response surface methodology, containing (per liter) soluble starch (19.73 g), beef extract (1.35 g), (NH4)(2)SO4 (3.05 g), NaCl (1.00 g), KH2PO4 (2.00 g), K2HPO4 (5.00 g), and MgSO4 (0.05 g) at pH 7.63. The bioflocculant is thermostable over a broad temperature range (4 degrees C to 60 degrees C) and has a wide pH stability (4 to 13).

The polysiloxane macromonomer can copolymerize with monomers of 3-methacryloxypropyl tris(trimethylsiloxy) silane (TRIS) and N, N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) to prepare transparent high RI silicone hydrogel. Increasing MA-CZ-PDMS macromonomer content in the silicone hydrogels improved its water content, RI value, and mechanical properties, however decreased slightly glass transition temperature (T-g) and transmittance of blue light.

Eligible subjects were enrolled at Period 1 and allocated to receive either test drug or placebo, and underwent a clinical assessment including vital signs, electrocardiography, laboratory examination (hemostasis parameters, routine hematology, liver and renal function), the presence of hemorrhagic symptoms and allergic reactions. Afterwards, they went on to a 2-week washout period, and then were crossedover to receive the alternate drug at Period 2. The procedure of Period 1 was repeated in the same manner with the alternate drug at Period 2. Results: Of 20 subjects enrolled, one subject was lost to follow-up on Evaluation Day-14 of Period 2.

Ten species of lichens including four chlorolichens (three Cladonia species and Stereocaulon scutelligerum), three tripartite lichens (Stereocaulon species) and three cyanolichens (Lichina pygmaea, Collema cristatum, Peltigera membranacea) belonging to six genera and six families were studied. One macroscopic cyanobacterium (Nostoc sp.), corresponding to the photobiont partner of Peltigera and Collema cyanolichens, was included for comparison. MIR spectra were acquired from lichen organic extracts between 3800-950 cm(-1) using a chalcogenide infrared fibre optical device. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and PCA-LDA (PCA-Linear Discriminant Analysis) based on the concept of variable clustering has been applied to absorbance MIR second derivative spectra for classification of the 11 species. The method succeeded in separating all lichen species and in identifying the major compounds. Moreover, the signature of the sample was specific of each lichen suggesting that minor compounds played a role. Our data showed that FEWS optical sensor profiling is a rapid, efficient and convenient tool for metabolic profiling and suggest that it can be used: (i) in chemotaxonomic approaches, (ii) in processes for certification requirements in active compounds availability, and (iii) in identifying new biosourcings in so far non-investigated lichen species.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Experimental and simulation studies of polyarginines across the membrane of giant unilamellar vesicles","Abstract":"Cell-penetrating peptides have widespread applications in biomedicine because of their capability to translocate across cell membranes alone or with cargos.

A series of quaterized and sulfosuccinylated maize starch (QSS) samples with different zeta potentials were derived by altering the molar ratio of TACHP to SS substituents for exploring the influences of TACHP and SS substituents on the adhesion of QSS to viscose fibers and surveying the removability of QSS from sized viscose yarns. A desirable ratio of TACHP to SS was determined for alleviating the adverse impacts of (1) sulfosuccination on the adhesion and (2) quaterization on the removability. The adhesion was determined by a standard method (FZ\/T 15001-2008), while the removability was assessed through an oxidant desizing under alkali conditions. It was found that this combined modification was able to alleviate the adverse impacts. The adhesion and removability of QSS were related to its zeta potential, depending on the ratio of TACHP to SS substituents. An increase in the potential favored adhesion, but disfavored removability. Electroneutral QSS had strong adhesion and good removability simultaneously, taking into account adhesion and removability. Furthermore, increasing the modification level at electroneutrality was helpful to the adhesion and removability.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Cellulose esters synthesized using a tetrabutylammonium acetate and dimethylsulfoxide solvent system","Abstract":"Cellulose acetate (CA) and cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) were homogeneously synthesized in a novel tetrabutylammonium acetate\/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent system, without any catalyst, at temperatures below 70 degrees C.

These extracellular vesicles (EV) were initially thought to be garbage bags through which the cell ejected its waste. Whilst this is a major function of one type of EV, i.e., apoptotic bodies, many EVs have intricate functions in intercellular communication and compound exchange; although their physiological roles are still ill-defined. Additionally, it is now becoming increasingly clear that EVs mediate disease progression and therefore studying EVs has ignited significant interests among researchers from various fields of life sciences. Consequently, the research effort into the pathogenic roles of EVs is significantly higher even though their protective roles are not well established.

It was found that steel slag could develop a compressive strength of 20 MPa in EAF slag and 36 MPa in EAF-BOF hybrid slag after a combination of carbonation and hydration. Higher calcium silicate content and longer carbonation time could result in a higher compressive strength. The activated steel slag binders were composed of calcium carbonates intermingled with calcium silicate hydrates, forming a particle reinforced composite material.

An effective barrier height (BH) value of 0.678eV and an ideality factor of n=1.665 have been obtained for the hybrid junction.

The composite samples were prepared by solution cast technique. The result of DC conductivity versus percolation threshold (Phi(-1\/3)) confirmed that at low AgI concentration, the tunneling effect governs ionic conduction mechanism. Nevertheless, at high filler concentration, the DC conductivity showed a plateau behavior. The DC conductivity as a function of reciprocal temperature revealed that the ion conduction mechanism is slightly temperature dependent and the ion-ion correlational effect is dominant. A steep increase in DC conductivity above 323 K is observed, which indicated the existence of some phase transition near the beta (beta)-phase. The drop of DC conductivity at high temperatures is anticipated from the impedance plots. The AC conductivity spectrum exhibited three distinct regions at low temperatures. The high-frequency regions of AC conductivity spectra were almost temperature independent at low temperatures (303-323 K) and obeyed the Jonscher's power law. The variation in frequency exponent versus temperature reveals that ion conduction mechanism follows QMT and CBH models at low and high temperatures, respectively. The valuable achievement of this work is that the temperature dependence of DC conductivity and the frequency exponent (s) is correlated to interpret the Ag+ ion dynamic and ion-ion correlational effect.

The uniform distribution of the embedded composite electrodes of AgNWs and aerogels was verified by the Joule heating test. The APP with the composite electrodes has a lower sheet resistance (R-s) and a better mechanical stability compared with APP without aerogels. The APP with the embedded electrodes is a freestanding flexible substrate and can be used as an electrode coating on a polymer substrate, such as polydimethylsiloxane and polyethylene terephthalate. On the basis of the bending test results, the APPs with composite electrodes were sufficiently flexible to withstand a 1 mm bending radius (r(b)) and could be foldable with a slight change in Rs.

Extending recent observations made with dextran-microcapsules loaded with alpha 2MG in experimental sepsis, we focused on the physical and chemical characteristics of these microstructures and determined their biology on rodent and human cells. We report an efficient encapsulation of alpha 2MG into microcapsules, which enhanced i) human leukocyte recruitment to inflamed endothelium and ii) human macrophage phagocytosis: in both settings microcapsules were more effective than soluble alpha 2MG or empty microcapsules (devoid of active protein). Translation of these findings revealed that intravenous administration of alpha 2MG-microcapsules (but not empty microcapsules) promoted neutrophil migration into peritoneal exudates and augmented macrophage phagocytic functions, the latter response being associated with alteration of bioactive lipid mediators as assessed by mass spectrometry.

A uniform coating of nanoscale MnO2 layers can be observed on the internal surface of 3D graphene, which could benefit rapid ionic and electronic transport. The electrochemical performance of the MnO2\/3D graphene composites is optimized by the control of the composite structure and mass loading of MnO2. The MnO2\/3D graphene composite thus prepared exhibits a significantly high specific capacitance of 659.7 F g(-1) at 03 A g(-1) and an excellent retention life of 106% after 1000 cycles. The facile synthesis and excellent electrochemical performance of the MnO2\/3D graphene composites indicate that the developed method demonstrates potential applications for the fabrication of novel electrode materials for use in energy storage devices.

However, the recycling of the waste is normally restricted by less efficient techniques and low attractive output; the utilization of such waste is still staying lower than 15%. In this work, the silica aerogel materials were synthesized by using a precursor extracted from recycled silicon-rich coal gangue, followed by a single-step surface silylation and ambient pressure drying. A low density (similar to 0.19 g\/cm(3)) nanostructured aerogel with a 3D open porous microstructure and high surface area (similar to 690 m(2)\/g) was synthesized, which presents a superior thermal insulation performance (similar to 26.5 mW.m(-1)K(-1) of a plane packed of 4-5 mm granules which was confirmed by transient hot-wire method). This study offers a new facile route to the synthesis of insulating aerogel material by recycling solid waste coal gangue and presents a potential cost reduction of industrial production of silica aerogels.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Folding of ortho-Phenylenes","Abstract":"In nature, the folding of oligomers and polymers is used to generate complex three-dimensional structures, yielding macromolecules with diverse functions in catalysis, recognition, transport, and charge- and energy-transfer. Over the past 20-30 years, chemists have sought to replicate this strategy by developing new foldamers: oligomers that fold into well-defined secondary structures in solution. A wide array of abiotic foldamers have been developed,. ranging from. non-natural peptides to aromatics. The ortho-phenylenes represent a recent addition to the family of aromatic foldamers. Despite their structural simplicity (chains of benzenes connected at the ortho positions), it was not until 2010 that systematic studies of o-phenylenes showed that they reliably fold into helices in solution (and in the solid state). This conformational behavior is of fundamental interest: o-Arylene and o-heteroarylene structures are found embedded within many other systems, part of an emerging interest in sterically congested polyphenylenes. Further, o-phenylenes are increasingly straightforward to synthesize because of continuing developments in arene-arene coupling, the Asao-Yamamoto benzannulation, and benzyne polymerization. In this Account, we discuss the folding of o-phenylenes with emphasis on features that make them unique among aromatic foldamers. Interconversion between their different backbone conformers is slow on the NMR time scale around room temperature. The H-1 NMR spectra of oligomers can therefore be deconvoluted to give sets of chemical shifts for different folding states. The chemical shifts are both highly sensitive to conformation and readily predicted using ab initio methods, affording critical information about the conformational distribution. The picture that emerges is that o-phenylenes fold into helices with offset stacking between every third repeat unit. In general, misfolding occurs primarily at the oligomer termini (i.e., \"frayed ends\"). Because of their structural simplicity, the folding can be described by straightforward models. The overall population can be divided into two enantiomeric pools, with racemization and misfolding as two distinct processes. Examination of substituent effects on folding reveals that the determinant of the relative stability of different conformers is (offset) aromatic stacking interactions parallel to the helical axis. That is, the folding of ophenylenes is analogous to that of alpha-helices, with aromatic stacking in place of hydrogen bonding. The folding propensity can be tuned using well-known substituent effects on aromatic stacking, with moderate electron-withdrawing substituents giving nearly perfect folding. The combination of a simple folding mechanism and readily characterized conformational populations makes ophenylenes attractive structural motifs for incorporation into more-complex architectures, an important part of the next phase of foldamer research.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Adsorption of Cu2+ and Cd2+ from aqueous solution by novel electrospun poly(vinyl alcohol)\/graphene oxide nanofibers","Abstract":"Novel poly(vinyl alcohol)\/graphene oxide (PVA\/GO) nanofibers were fabricated by electrospinning and applied to remove Cu2+ and Cd2+ from aqueous solution. The adsorption performances of the PVA\/GO nanofibers were investigated by removing Cu2+ and Cd2+. The results showed that the adsorption of Cu2+ and Cd2+ onto PVA\/GO nanofibers increased as the pH was increasing, but only slightly reduced with the increasing of ionic strength. The adsorption could reach equilibrium within 25 min and the experimental kinetic data followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The equilibrium adsorption data can be well fitted with the Langmuir model. The thermodynamic parameters calculated from adsorption isotherms at four different temperatures indicated that the adsorption processes were endothermic and spontaneous. The PVA\/GO nanofibers have good regeneration ability and can be recycled 8 times with a small amount of loss in adsorption efficiency.

The WT pHLIP inserts into membranes with a pH(50) of 6.1, while most solid tumors have extracellular pH (pH(e)) of 6.5-7.0. To close this gap, a SAR study was carried out to search for pHLIP variants with improved pH response. Replacing Asp25 with a-aminoadipic acid (Aad) adjusts the pH(50) to 6.74, matching average tumor acidity, and replacing Asp14 with gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) increases the sharpness of pH response (transition over 0.5 instead of 1 pH unit). These effects are additive: the Asp14Gla\/Asp25Aad double variant shows a pH(50) of 6.79, with sharper transition than Asp25Aad.

In this study, a family of multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT)\/elastomeric triisocyanate-crosslinked polytetrahydrofuran (ETC-PTHF) nanocomposites that are highly stretchable and highly sensitive to mechanical stimuli were designed, synthesized, and characterized. The CNTs in the CNT\/ETC-PTHF nanocomposites were initially dispersed in the ETC-PTHF matrix uniformly, leading to a relatively high electrical conductivity. Upon stretching, both the degree of CNT alignment along the stretching direction and the degree of PTHF crystallinity increased consistently with the tensile strain. The strain-induced microstructure change adversely affected the CNT conducting pathways, thereby reducing the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites. For instance, the electrical conductivity of the 15 wt% CNT\/ETC-PTHF nanocomposites decreased by approximately 7.3%, 29.2%, and 19.76, 169.2 and 1291 times when the tensile strain was 1%, 5%, 50%, 250%, and 500%, respectively. The nanocomposite film was able to detect a mechanical stimulus (poking) weaker than the landing force of a mosquito. Furthermore, the nanocomposite film demonstrated rapid and highly sensitive responses to continuous finger motion. These new piezoresistive CNT\/ETC-PTHF nanocomposites possess a number of desirable characteristics including ease of fabrication, low cost, and high sensitivity, thereby making them very promising candidates for applications in electronic skins, electronic textiles, and biomedical detectors.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Robust Design of a Particle-Free Silver-Organo-Complex Ink with High Conductivity and Inkjet Stability for Flexible Electronics","Abstract":"Currently, silver-nanoparticle-based inkjet ink is commercially available. This type of ink has several serious problems such as a complex synthesis protocol, high cost, high sintering temperatures (similar to 200 degrees C), particle aggregation, nozzle clogging, poor shelf life, and jetting instability. For the emerging field of printed electronics, these shortcomings in conductive inks are barriers for their widespread use in practical applications. Formulating particle-free silver inks has potential to solve these issues and requires careful design of the silver complexation. The ink complex must meet various requirements, such as in situ reduction, optimum viscosity, storage and jetting stability, smooth uniform sintered films, excellent adhesion, and high conductivity. This study presents a robust formulation of silver-organo-complex (SOC) ink, where complexing molecules act as reducing agents. The 17 wt % silver loaded ink was printed and sintered on a wide range of substrates with uniform surface morphology and excellent adhesion. The jetting stability was monitored for 5 months to confirm that the ink was robust and highly stable with consistent jetting performance.

Si is one of the most promising anode materials due to its extremely high specific capacity. However, the full application of Si-based anode materials is limited by poor cycle life and rate capability resulted from low ionic\/electronic conductivity and large volume change over cycling. In recent years, great progress has been made in improving the performance of Si anodes by employing nanotechnology. The preparation methods are essentially important, in which the precursors used are crucial to design and control the microstructure for the Si-based materials. In this review, we provide comprehensive summary and comment on different Si-containing precursors for preparation of nanosized Si-based anode materials and focus on the corresponding electrochemical performances in lithium-ion batteries. Bulk sized silicon, silicon wafer and silicon microparticles are generally used as starting materials to synthesize porous or nanosized silicon, and the routes for the synthesis are rather mature and commercially available. Silica is also commonly used to form silicon by conversion through a facile magnesiothermic reduction. Silica derivation from natural resources, especially from rice husks, is much more sustainable and lower cost than alternative methods, which attracts considerable research attention. In addition, gaseous Si-based sources like SiH4, Si2H6 and SiHx Cl-y, liquid silicon sources like trisilane and phenylsilane and elemental silicon have successfully used to prepare nanosized or carbon coated silicon. Further considerations on massive production possibility have also been presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier BY.

The programmable morphology was experimentally explored along with a computational simulation to understand the mechanism of shape reconfiguration. The neutron reflectivity shows that the active silk ionomers layer undergoes remarkable swelling (eight times increase in thickness) after deprotonation while the passive silk fi-sheet retains constant volume under the same conditions and supports the bimorph construct. This selective swelling within the silk-on-silk bimorph microsheets generates strong interfacial stress between layers and out-of-plane forces, which trigger autonomous self -rolling into various 3D constructs such as cylindrical and helical tubules. The experimental observations and computational modeling confirmed the role of interfacial stresses and allow programming the morphology of the 3D constructs with particular design. We demonstrated that the biaxial stress distribution over the 2D planar films depends upon the lateral dimensions, thickness and the aspect ratio of the microsheets. The results allow the fine-tuning of autonomous shape transformations for the further design of complex micro origami constructs and the silk based rolling\/unrolling structures provide a promising platform for polymer -based biomimetic devices for implant applications.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Detecting Cytosolic Peptide Delivery with the GFP Complementation Assay in the Low Micromolar Range","Abstract":"Transfection of cells with a plasmid encoding for the first ten strands of the GFP protein (GFP1-10) provides the means to detect cytosolic peptide import at low micromolar concentrations.

These hepatic functions are orchestrated through a multilevel regulation composed of metabolic, signaling and transcriptional networks. Plasma macronutrients namely, glucose, amino acids and fatty acids are known to influence these regulatory mechanisms to facilitate homeostasis. We composed a regulatory circuit that elicits the design principle behind the metabolic regulation in liver. We have developed a detailed dynamic model for hepatic metabolism incorporating the regulatory mechanisms at signaling and transcriptional level. The model was analyzed to capture the behavior of hepatic metabolic fluxes under various combinations of plasma macronutrient levels. The model was used to rationalize and explain the experimental observations of metabolic dysfunctions through regulatory mechanisms. We addressed the key questions such as, how high carbohydrate diet increases cholesterol and why a high protein diet would reduce it; how high fat and high protein diet increases gluconeogenesis leading to hyperglycemia; how TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle is impaired through diet induced insulin resistance; how high fat can impair plasma ammonia balance; how high plasma glucose can lead to dyslipidemia and fatty liver disease etc. The analysis indicates that higher levels (above 2.5-3 fold) of macronutrient in plasma results in impairment of metabolic functions due to perturbations in the regulatory circuit. While higher glucose levels saturate the rate of plasma glucose uptake, higher amino acids activate glucagon and inhibit IRS (insulin receptor substrate) through S6K (S6 kinase), whereas higher fatty acid levels inhibit IRS through DAG-PKC (diacylglycerol and protein kinase C) and TRB3 activation. Moreover the ATP-ADP ratio is reduced under such conditions and beta-oxidation is up-regulated through activation of PPAR alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha) leading to reduced anabolic capacity and increased cataplerosis in TCA cycle. The above factors together decrease insulin sensitivity and enhances glucagon effect through underlying signaling and transcriptional network leading to insulin resistance in liver. Such a metabolic state is known to result in diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Electrosprayed nanoparticles and electrospun nanofibers based on natural materials: applications in tissue regeneration, drug delivery and pharmaceuticals","Abstract":"Nanotechnology refers to the fabrication, characterization, and application of substances in nanometer scale dimensions for various ends.

While low-level, athermal radiofrequency exposure in the HF band alone had no significant effect on membrane structure or dynamics, it did partially reverse the consequences of CNT interactions with the membrane by producing a new membrane structure, possibly consistent with gel-or cubic-phase formation.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Magnetic cellulose-TiO2 nanocomposite microspheres for highly selective enrichment of phosphopeptides","Abstract":"Novel magnetic cellulose-TiO2 nanocomposite microspheres with high surface areas and magnetic susceptibility were fabricated, which exhibited remarkably selective enrichment of trace phosphopeptides from peptide mixtures.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Comprehensive Laboratory Evaluation of Thermophysical Properties of Pavement Materials: Effects on Urban Heat Island","Abstract":"In the context of urban heat islands (UHI), sustainable solutions are being devised to craft greener built environments such as cooler roofs and pavements mainly to counter a variation of thermal flux within the urban climates. Modification of the pavement thermal properties is a potential strategy to render pavements cooler with different cooling mechanisms. The thermal behavior of pavements is largely dependent on the different but interactive thermal properties of pavement materials such as thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, density, albedo, thermal emissivity, and not on one single property alone. The objective of this research study was to investigate the thermophysical properties of different pavement systems through the development of a comprehensive methodology that can quantify contribution of thermal properties on urban climates from laboratory-based measurements. Six different paving mixtures including conventional dense-graded, asphalt-rubber, and cement concrete mixes were prepared encompassing 96 sample data points for the experimental program. With an increase in specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and albedo, there was a decrease in the maximum pavement surface temperature of the various mixes. Although the investigation of thermal behavior of pavement materials is complex in nature, this laboratory study has attempted to investigate all major thermophysical properties of different pavement systems in a comprehensive manner. It is envisioned that this research study will help advance the state of the art and knowledge related to pavements' selection and contribution to urban climates, and in recommending a suitable UHI mitigation strategy from the pavements' perspective.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Safety and pharmacodynamics of suprachoroidal injection of triamcinolone acetonide as a controlled ocular drug release model","Abstract":"Suprachoroidal injection is an emerging technique for drug delivery to the posterior segment, which is hard to reach by non-invasive approaches. However, the injection technique varies and the associated ocular safety is not well understood. In addition, it is not clear if drug formulation is a major factor in optimizing pharmacodynamics using this technique. The current study was designed to compare the suprachoroidal injection of different drug formulations and to characterize the safety and pharmacodynamics of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) delivered by this technique. Both indocyanine green (ICG) solution and TA suspension, at 50 mu L, 100 mu L, and 150 mu L, were suprachoroidally injected and intraocular pressure (IOP) tonometry, fundus photography, and electroretinography were performed over multiple time points up to eight weeks. After 50 mu L TA (Kenalog-40) suprachoroidal injection, 4-5 animals at 7 time points were sacrificed for aqueous, vitreous, retina, and plasma collections. TA was quantitated using ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. For comparative efficacy study, 50 mu L (2 mg) suprachoroidal TA versus 20 mg subtenon TA were performed 4 weeks before induction of experimental uveitis with 10 ng of intravitreal lipopolysaccharide. After suprachoroidal injection, IOP had an acute elevation, higher volume caused higher IOP (p < 0.0001). Equivalent volume of ICG solution led to a significantly smaller IOP elevation than after TA suprachoroidal injection. This finding suggests better distribution of ICG solution than TA suspension in the suprachoroidal space. Following a 50 mu L suprachoroidal injection, peak TA concentration in the aqueous was below 1 ng\/mL. In contrast, the posterior vitreous and retina had 1912 ng\/mL and 400,369 ng\/mL TA, respectively. Maximum TA in plasma was 11.6 ng\/mL. Drug exposure to the posterior retina was 523,910 times more than that to the aqueous and 29,516 times more than systemic TA exposure. In the treatment of lipopolysaccharide-induced uveitis, compared with 20 mg subtenon injection, suprachoroidal 2 mg TA demonstrated much better efficacy with significantly less aqueous humor cells and lower vitreous opacity scores (p < 0.05). Histology showed much less vitreous inflammation in the suprachoroidal injection group (p < 0.0001). It seems that a 50 mu L suprachoroidal injection of TA was well tolerated in rabbit eyes and demonstrated excellent penetration into the posterior retina, providing better therapeutic effect than subtenon 20 mg TA.

Additionally, their superparamagnetic properties provide a convenient means for bulk collection of the material from solution after the targeted ions have been adsorbed. Herein, two nanoscale amphoteric metal oxides, each possessing useful magnetic attributes, were evaluated for their ability to collect trace levels of a chemically diverse range of alpha emitting radioactive isotopes (polonium (Po), radium (Ra), uranium (U), and americium (Am)) from a wide range of aqueous solutions. The nanomaterials include commercially available magnetite (Fe3O4) and magnetite modified to incorporate manganese (Mn) into the crystal structure. The chemical stability of these nanomaterials was evaluated in Hanford Site, WA ground water between the natural pH (similar to 8) and pH 1. Whereas the magnetite was observed to have good stability over the pH range, the Mn-doped material was observed to leach Mn at low pH. The materials were evaluated in parallel to characterize their uptake performance of the alpha-emitting radionuclide spikes from ground water across a range of pH (from similar to 8 down to 2). In addition, radiotracer uptake experiments were performed on Columbia River water, seawater, and human urine at their natural pH and at pH 2. Despite the observed leaching of Mn from the Mn-doped nanomaterial in the lower pH range, it exhibited generally superior analyte extraction performance compared to the magnetite, and analyte uptake was observed across a broader pH range. We show that the uptake behavior of the various radiotracers on these two materials at different pH levels can generally be explained by the amphoteric nature of the nanoparticle surfaces. Finally, the rate of sorption of the radiotracers on the two materials in unacidified ground water was evaluated. The uptake curves generally indicate that equilibrium is obtained within a few minutes, which is attributed to the high surface areas of the nanomaterials and the high level of dispersion in the liquids. Overall, the results indicate that these nanomaterials may have the potential to be employed for a range of applications to extract radionuclides from aqueous solutions.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Biochemistry-derived porous carbon-encapsulated metal oxide nanocrystals for enhanced sodium storage","Abstract":"Transitional metal oxides are promising anode materials for sodium ion batteries (SIBS) due to their high theoretical capacities and material abundance; however, their sodium storage capability is significantly hindered by the sluggish sodiation\/desodiation reaction kinetics.

The present study thus focuses on the development of an integrated downstream processing strategy for the concomitant extraction of lipid and carbohydrate as feedstocks for potential biofuel applications. A harvesting efficiency of up to 90.6 +\/- 2.8% and 98.7 +\/- 2.1% was accomplished for Chlorococcum cells by employing minimal FeCl3 in first the 30 min and 150 min, respectively, as opposed to 55.52 +\/- 2.2% in 30 min using only its self-flocculation ability. Various physical and chemical pretreatment methods were attempted to maximize the recovery of sugars and lipids, separately and simultaneously. Microalgal lipid was efficiently recovered using cell disruption with bead-beating and chloroform-methanol (2 : 1, v\/v) as the extraction solvent. The microalgal carbohydrate recovery and conversion into free fermentable sugars was found to be greater in the case of acid hydrolysis as compared to alkaline hydrolysis. The microalgal biomass, when pretreated separately, gave a total sugar yield of 89.6 +\/- 3.1% and a total lipid yield of 96.2 +\/- 2.9%. Therefore, to improve the performance of the process, simultaneous extraction of carbohydrate and lipid was carried out using bead-beating followed by acid treatment. The recoveries of fermentable sugars from the supernatant and that of lipid from pellets were most efficient, with respective yields of nearly 86.5 +\/- 2.6% and 74.1 +\/- 1.8%, without any downtime.

Despite commercial success of primary Zn-air batteries, performances of rechargeable Zn-air batteries are still far below practically satisfactory levels. Among critical challenges facing the electrochemical rechargeability, the crossover of zincate (Zn(OH)(4)(2-)) ions from the Zn anode to the air cathode (via separator membranes) is a formidable bottleneck. Here, as a facile and scalable polymer architecture strategy to address this ion transport issue, we demonstrate a new class of polymer blend electrolyte membranes with artificially engineered, bicontinuous anion-conducting\/-repelling phases (referred to as \"PBE membranes\").

The charges on the capacitor exert a force on the membrane that leads to electrostriction, i.e. a thinning of the membrane. Since the force is quadratic in voltage, negative and positive voltage have an identical influence on the physics of symmetric membranes. However, this is not the case for a membrane with an asymmetry leading to a permanent electric polarization. Positive and negative voltages of identical magnitude lead to different properties. Such an asymmetry can originate from a lipid composition that is different on the two monolayers of the membrane, or from membrane curvature. The latter effect is called 'flexoelectricity'. As a consequence of permanent polarization, the membrane capacitor is discharged at a voltage different from zero. This leads to interesting electrical phenomena such as outward or inward rectification of membrane permeability. Here, we introduce a generalized theoretical framework, that treats capacitance, polarization, flexoelectricity, piezoelectricity and thermoelectricity in the same language.

Half-antibody fragment-functionalized Au\/MNCs were used to capture Salmonella in milk and then dispersed in a small volume of buffer solution in which one end of the lateral flow filter was immersed. The free Au\/MNCs rose to the pressed test line, while the Salmonella-Au\/MNC complexes remained in the solution because they were too large to pass through the pores inside the lateral flow filter. The flow of free Au\/MNCs was blocked at the test line because of the reduced pore size, and their accumulation caused the test line to darken. The color of the test line was inversely proportional to the Salmonella concentration, and the limit of detection for Salmonella in milk was determined to be 103 CFU mL(-1) after image processing.

The yield from the ultrasonic extraction was compared with that from traditional Soxhlet extraction. The results showed that ultrasonic extraction could be completed in a shorter time with reduced solvent consumption. The yield of tara seed oil increased with increasing ultrasonication power and extraction temperature.

Nonaqueous battery systems can potentially achieve high energy density because of their broad voltage window. In this paper, we report a new organic redox-active material for use in a nonaqueous redox flow battery, 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) that has high solubility (> 2.6 M) in organic solvents. PTIO exhibits electrochemically reversible disproportionation reactions and thus can serve as both anolyte and catholyte redox materials in a symmetric flow cell. The PTIO flow battery has a moderate cell voltage of similar to 1.7 V and shows good cyclability under both cyclic voltammetry and flow cell conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that FTIR can offer accurate estimation of the PTIO concentration in electrolytes and determine the state of charge of the PTIO flow cell, suggesting FTIR as a powerful online battery status sensor. This study is expected to inspire more insights in this under-addressed area of state of charge analysis aiming at operational safety and reliability of flow batteries.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"The Comparative Study on Vapor-Polymerization and Pressure-dependent Conductance Behavior in Polypyrrole-hybridized Membranes","Abstract":"In this study, commercially available cellulose membranes were hybridized with conjugated polymer via vapor-phase polymerization using pyrrole and iron chloride as a monomer and oxidant, respectively. The iron (III) chloride layer dip-coated on the hydrophilic cellulose surface oxidized the vaporized pyrrole monomer leading to the polypyrrole-cellulose hybrid membrane. The conductivity of hybrid membrane was optimized by varying the oxidant concentration and the monomer vapor exposure time. The various surface characterizations of polypyrrole-cellulose hybrid membrane show that the conductive polypyrrole layer was uniformly deposited onto the surface of cellulose fibrous networks unlike the polypyrrole-nylon hybrid membrane prepared in the similar way. The polypyrrole-incorporated cellulose networks exhibits steeper electrical conductance increase over the vertical pressure than its nylon counterpart. Our result suggests that the polypyrrole-cellulose hybrid membrane can be applicable for a disposable high-load pressure sensor.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Effects on lipid bilayer and nitrogen distribution induced by lateral pressure","Abstract":"The lateral pressure exerted on cell membrane is of great importance to signal transduction. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulation to explore how lateral pressure affects the biophysical properties of lipid bilayer as well as nitrogen distribution in the membrane. Our results show that both physical properties of cell membrane and nitrogen distribution are highly sensitive to the lateral pressure. With the increasing lateral pressure, area per lipid drops and thickness of membrane increases obviously, while nitrogen molecules are more congested in the center of lipid bilayer than those under lower lateral pressure. These results suggest that the mechanism of nitrogen narcosis may be related to the lateral pressure.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Controllable assembly of SnO2 nanocubes onto TiO2 electrospun nanofibers toward humidity sensing applications","Abstract":"One-dimensional SnO2\/TiO2 heterostructures were successfully synthesized through the hydrothermal assembly of the single-crystalline SnO2 nanocubes onto the TiO2 electrospun nanofibers. The as-synthesized heterostructures with controllable coverage density of SnO2 nanocubes were then coated onto the ceramic-based interdigital electrodes to produce the humidity nanosensors for the investigation of their humidity sensing characteristics. The results showed that the optimal nanosensor with similar to 20 at% SnO2-based heterostructure exhibited good humidity sensitivity, fast response-recovery behavior, low humidity hysteresis, and good reproducibility. In particular, the response and recovery times of this optimal nanosensor could reach similar to 2.4 s and similar to 30.2 s, respectively, which were considerably shorter than the corresponding values of TiO2 nanofiber-based humidity nanosensors. The improved sensitivity characteristics for the SnO2\/TiO2 heterostructures can be attributed to the interfacial electron transfer between SnO2 nanocubes and TiO2 nanofibers, which leads to an appropriate height of the potential barrier on the surface of the heterostructures for water adsorption and desorption. Our proposed humidity sensing mechanism would provide opportunities to guide the design and fabrication of other high-performance humidity sensors based on semiconductor heterostructures.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Biotemplated synthesis of hierarchically nanostructured TiO2 using cellulose and its applications in photocatalysis","Abstract":"Hierarchically nanostructured TiO2 has been hydrothermally synthesized using cellulose as a biotemplate involving various types of acids.

In this study, we first used molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the effective hydrated ionic size and the free energy of solvation, and then developed correlations allowing for the prediction of these quantities. The temperature dependence of these solution properties was also investigated. Our studies have shown that the effective (hydrated) size, the charge density, and the free energy of solvation of the ions are strongly interdependent.

The results indicated that CMB adsorbed more Cr(VI) (120 mg g(-1)) than that of pristine biochar (30 mg g(-1)). The sorption data could be well illustrated by pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models. Furthermore, thermodynamic parameters revealed that the sorption reaction was an endothermic and spontaneous process. The adsorption of Cr(VI) was influenced by solution pH and the maximum sorption capacity was achieved at pH 2. The background electrolyte PO43- and SO42- restricted the Cr(VI) sorption.

With the increase of the concentration of Na+ the films became thinner and at 0.5 mol dm(-3) their equilibrium thickness was similar to 9 nm (common black films).

We herein report a triazine-based carbon nitride (CN) material with different C\/N ratios achieved by varying the monomer composition ratio between melamine (Mel) and 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine (TAP). The CN material with a different C\/N ratio was obtained through a two-step synthesis protocol: starting with the solution state dispersion of the monomers via hydrogen-bonding supramolecular aggregate, followed by a salt-melt high temperature polycondensation. This protocol ensures the production of a highly crystalline polytriazine imide (PTI) structure consisting of a copolymerized Mel-TAP network. The observed bandgap narrowing with an increasing TAP\/Mel ratio is well simulated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing a negative shift in the valence band upon substitution of N with CH in the aromatic rings. Increasing the TAP amount could not maintain the crystalline PTI structure, consistent with DFT calculation showing the repulsion associated with additional C-H introduced in the aromatic rings. Because of the high exciton binding energy calculated by DFT for the obtained CN, the cocatalyst must be close to any portion of the material to assist the separation of excited charge carriers for an improved photocatalytic performance. The photocatalytic activity was improved by providing a dendritic tip-on-like shape grown on porous fibrous silica KCC-1 spheres, and highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles (<5 nm) were photodeposited to introduce heterojunction. As a result, the Pt\/CN\/KCC-1 photocatalyst exhibited an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) as high as 22.1 +\/- 3% at 400 nm, and the silica was also beneficial for improving photocatalytic stability. The results obtained by time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy measurements were consistent with the improved photocatalytic activity with the slowest carrier recombination for the optimized CN photocatalyst.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Graphene-based nitrogen self-doped hierarchical porous carbon aerogels derived from chitosan for high performance supercapacitors","Abstract":"Graphene-based nitrogen self-doped hierarchical porous carbon aerogels were synthesized for supercapacitor electrode application by using chitosan as a raw material through a carefully controlled aerogel formation-carbonization-activation process. The as-synthesized N-doped graphene-based carbon aerogels contained both macropores and mesopores from the aerogel preparation and carbonization process, and micropores from the chemical activation, confirmed by TEM, SEM, BET, etc. Because chitosan is a nitrogen-containing renewable biopolymer, the carbon aerogel derived from chitosan in this work was N-self -doped. The carbonized carbon aerogel was composed of a graphene framework and amorphous carbon, and the ratio between these two components was controlled by the activation temperature. With an increase in activation temperature, the amorphous carbon was etched away gradually, and a stable graphene portion remained to form a framework. Accordingly, the performance of the graphene-based carbon aerogel as a supercapacitor varied with increasing activation temperature. Electrochemical investigation measurements showed that the N-doped graphene-based hierarchical porous carbon aerogel represents a good electrode candidate for construction of a solid symmetric supercapacitor, which displays a high specific capacitance of about 197 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1).

Three lipid samples: cocoa butter (CB), palm kernel oil (PO) and 20% (w\/w) cocoa powder in palm kernel oil (CPPO) were prepared by two methods, shearing during crystallization and static crystallization. Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging, samples' moisture uptake at a storage temperature of 20 degrees C was measured for 91 days and their effective diffusivity values were calculated. It was found that shearing reduces effective diffusivity of moisture in samples, thereby increasing their moisture-barrier capacity compared to unprocessed lipid systems. The mechanism of moisture migration was found to be a combination of Fickian diffusion and relaxation of lipid matrix in the statically crystallized cocoa butter samples, whereas Fickian diffusion was the dominant mechanism in sheared cocoa butter samples. Palm kernel oil samples exhibited a combination of Fickian and relaxation mechanisms, regardless of the processing technique. Whereas the mixture of palm kernel oil and cocoa powder samples showed relaxation-mechanism controlled migration due to the presence of hydrophilic cocoa powder particles.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Tuning Ni nanoparticles and the acid sites of silica-alumina for liquefaction and hydrodeoxygenation of lignin to cyclic alkanes","Abstract":"A facile and effective method for the one-pot hydrodeoxygenation of enzymatic lignin to C-6-C-9 cycloalkanes is reported in liquid dodecane with 100 C% selectivity (approaching 50 wt% yield). The method enables 80 wt% lignin conversion by using Ni catalyst-supported amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) at 300 degrees C in the presence of 6 MPa H-2. The crucial factors to achieve direct lignin hydrodeoxygenation are the suitable balance in solvent selection and the design of active sites in the solvent liquid phase. The activity of Ni nanoparticles in dodecane leads to higher efficiency in the deconstruction of external C-O bonds in lignin. The consumption of lignin shifts the equilibrium of lignin solubility and weakens the impact of the relatively poor lignin solubility in dodecane for lignin depolymerization. The key element in controlling the activity of Ni-based catalysts is the specific external surface areas of diverse supports as well as the sizes of metallic Ni sites. This is probably because of the high external surface areas that can provide good contact opportunities for Ni sites in the lignin macromolecule. The efficient contact of active sites in the polymer reactant is the most important factor for such solid-solid reactions. The size and distribution of active Ni sites as well as the specific surface areas of Ni\/ASA as modified by the different deposition precipitation times, reduction temperatures, and Ce additives can greatly affect the ability of a metal to attack the external C-O bonds of lignin. Furthermore, the acidity of the support (especially Bronsted acid sites) as modified by the Si\/Al ratio of ASA significantly enhances the capabilities and alters the electronic structures of Ni nanoparticles for cleavage of the C-O linkages of lignin. This suggests that the synergy of acid and metal sites can be subtly tailored to strengthen the catalytic performance of Ni metallic sites. In addition, the presence of acidic sites catalyzes the dehydration of cyclic alcohols intermediates and facilitates the hydrodeoxygenation of the derived phenolic fragments to cyclic alkanes.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Water Vapor Sensors Based on the Swelling of Relief Gelatin Gratings","Abstract":"We report on a novel device to measure relative humidity.

The anaerobic activated sludge is mainly composed of the bacteria belonging to phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, and the archaea belonging to phylum Methnomicrobiales. The cultured anaerobic sludge has been demonstrated efficient for treating X-GRL wastewater. All color and more than 95% of aromatic amines were removed with an X-GRL concentration of 200 mg L-1 and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 60 h. Batch assays were employed to investigate the anaerobic biotransformation of X-GRL. The sucrose added to the influent acts as an initial electron donor for the reduction of the azo bond, generating colorless aromatic amines. Aromatic amines were then completely degraded to CO2, CH4 and NH3 by anaerobic activated sludge, avoiding the secondary pollution by the dye pollutant.

Well-defined structures in which the triazine unit persists in the final material exhibit very low capacities at voltages relevant for cathode materials (<10 mA.h g(-1)). Relatively high, reversible capacity (around 150 mA-h g(-1)) is in fact displayed by amorphous materials with little evidence of triazine functionality. This result directly contradicts previous suggestions that the triazine unit is responsible for charge storage in this family of materials. While the gently sloping discharge and charge profiles suggest a capacitive-type mechanism-further confirmed by the trend of increasing capacity with increasing surface area-electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy studies show that the materials exhibiting higher capacities also display substantial EPR signals, potentially implicating unpaired spins in a charge storage mechanism that could involve charge transfer.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Fibrous Epoxy Substrate with High Thermal Conductivity and Low Dielectric Property for Flexible Electronics","Abstract":"Flexible substrates that host electronic components are an essential part of flexible electronics. The continuing miniaturization of these electronics requires flexible substrates with excellent flexibility, high thermal conductivity, and low dielectric constant. However, to combine these intended properties remains a daunting challenge. Here, a flexible fibrous epoxy substrate fabricated by an electrospinning technique is reported, which exhibits excellent flexibility, high thermal conductivity, and low dielectric constant. The thermal conductivity can be tuned by varying the diameter of fibers and can reach values as high as 0.8 W m(-1) K-1 , which is about three times higher than that of casted epoxy substrate fabricated by spin-coating. This excellent performance is attributed to polymer molecular chain alignment and fibrous structure that are formed during electrospinning. Demonstrative applications suggests its broad potential uses in future flexible electronics.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Preparation of porous SnO2\/ZnO nanotubes via a single spinneret electrospinning technique as anodes for lithium ion batteries","Abstract":"The novel SnO2\/ZnO nanotubes had been synthesized by a simple electrospinning method.

Silver and platinum nanoparticles are used in medicine, biotechnology and cosmetics and have electrocatalytic properties. However, GO has been found to be toxic to a variety of cells; pure graphene is insoluble; and nanoparticles aggregate, diminishing their activity. This research functionalized GO and rGO with silver or platinum nanoparticles (Ag\/PtNPs) and experimental solutions were then tested on bacteria, dermal fibroblasts (DFBC's), and cancerous (SCC13' s) and noncancerous (DO33' s) epidermal cells to determine toxicity and\/or cell viability.

This phenomenon might damage our health and environment if the nanomaterials used are found to be toxic and they are released into the waters when the products degrade. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of fluorinated nanocarbons (CXFs), a group of nanomaterials which can find applications in solid lubricants and lithium primary batteries. Our cell viability findings indicated that the toxicological effects induced by the CXF are dependent on the dose, size, shape, and fluorine content of the CXF. In addition, we verified that CXFs have insignificant interactions with the cell viability assaysmethylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-8), thus suggesting that the cytotoxicity data obtained are unlikely to be affected by CXF-induced artifacts and the results will be reliable.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Carbon nanofiber matrix with embedded LaCO3OH synchronously captures phosphate and organic carbon to starve bacteria","Abstract":"Microbial growth in water poses a growing threat to humans. Nutrient starvation is an effective and green manner to control microbial growth in water. The general coexisting phosphate and organic carbon in water can both serve as nutrients for microbial metabolism, and thus one can take a heavy toll on the performance of a nutrient-starvation antibacterial approach based on the other. Herein, carbon nanofibers with embedded LaCO3OH nanoparticles (LCNFs) were rationally synthesized by carbonizing electrospun polyacrylonitrile nanofibers containing La-species. The LCNFs served as a capture agent for both phosphate and organic matter to realize more effective nutrient-starvation antibacterial activity for water security. The LCNFs rendered high phosphate removal efficiency through the strong chemical bond between LaCO3OH and phosphate, even for trace phosphate concentrations. At the same time, organic nutrients could be synchronously cut down by LCNFs, which resulted in more stringent nutrient-deficient conditions to control microbial growth in water effectively.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Fluorescent Nanocomposite of Embedded Ceria Nanoparticles in Crosslinked PVA Electrospun Nanofibers","Abstract":"This paper introduces a new fluorescent nanocomposite of electrospun biodegradable nanofibers embedded with optical nanoparticles.

Under near-ultra violet excitation, the synthesized nanocomposite generates a visible fluorescent emission at 520 nm, varying its intensity peak according to the concentration of in situ embedded ceria nanoparticles. This is due to the fact that the embedded ceria nanoparticles have optical tri-valiant cerium ions, associated with formed oxygen vacancies, with a direct allowed bandgap around 3.5 eV. In addition, the impact of chemical crosslinking of the PVA on the fluorescence emission is studied in both cases of adding ceria nanoparticles in situ or of a post-synthesis addition via a spin-coating mechanism. Other optical and structural characteristics such as absorbance dispersion, direct bandgap, FTIR spectroscopy, and SEM analysis are presented.

Exploration of an appropriate post-annealing process is significant to gain insight into the crystallization of solar materials. The earth-abundant Cu2MnSnS4 (CMTS) thin films were fabricated by post-sulfuring as-prepared precursors and the results have been compared with that of directed-annealed samples. It was found that the sulfurization procedure not only can support to enhance the crystallinity but also help to obtain a nearly stoichiometric CMTS thin film which also free of SnS secondary phase. This reaction also contributes to sustainable incorporation of S into CMTS to a considerable extent and formation of notable large grains; whereas, it leads to the formation of a typical bi-layer microstructure containing large grains (500-800 nm) on the top and fine grains at the bottom. Through the sulfurization approach, the device performance is improved with the power conversion efficiency shows a 170% increase which mainly via the boost of open circuit and fill factor compared with that of direct-annealed processed.

Herein we have investigated the alterations in the physicochemical properties of protic\/aprotic ILs, (2-hydroxyethylammonium formate\/1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) upon reciprocal binary mixing. Melting point analysis of the mixtures at various mole fractions showed their deep eutectic solvent nature. The variation in physical properties like density, speed of sound, and viscosity have been measured and utilized to derive the volume of mixing, isentropic compressibility, and activation energy of the viscous flow. Unlike the binary mixtures of ILs having common cations or anions, the investigated reciprocal binary mixture showed significant non-ideality, normally desired to take advantage of improved solvent properties. The polarity and ion-ion interactions have been studied through solvatochromic parameters (normalized Reichardt's parameter, dipolarity\/polarizability, and hydrogen bond donor and acceptor coefficients) derived using solvatochromic probes. The prepared binary mixtures have been utilized for the dissolution of a gelling biopolymer agarose and formation of ionogels. Dissolution of agarose has been correlated with the solvatochromic parameters and the viscoelastic behaviour of ionogels is discussed in light of rheological measurements.

Electrospinning appears to be the ultimate technique to generate biocompatible and biodegradable polymer\/metal-oxide nanofibers, such as carbon, ZnO, TiO2, and NiO, for highly sensitive biosensing applications. Biosensors with enhanced sensitivity are becoming fascinating for the sensing of blood, and in particular for glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and low density lipoprotein( LDL) affinity sensing.

Developments in DNA nanotechnologies have transformed our thinking about the applications of nucleic acids. Progress from designed assemblies to functional outputs will continue to benefit from functionalities added to the nucleic acids that can participate in reactions or interactions beyond hybridiation. In that respect, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are interesting because they combine the hybridization properties of DNA with the modularity of peptides. In fact, PNAs form more stable duplexes with DNA or RNA than the corresponding natural homoduplexes. The high stability achieved with shorter oligomers (an 8-mer is sufficient for a stable duplex at room temperature) typically results in very high sequence fidelity in the hybridization with negligible impact of the ionic strength of the buffer due to the lack of electrostatic repulsion between the duplex strands. The simple peptidic backbone of PNA has been shown to be tolerant of modifications with substitutions that further enhance the duplex stability while providing opportunities for functionalization. Moreover, the metabolic stability of PNAs facilitates their integration into systems that interface with biology. Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in using PNAs as biosupramolecular tags to program assemblies and reactions. A series of robust templated reactions have been developed with functionalized PNA. These reactions can be used to translate DNA templates into functional polymers of unprecedented complexity, fluorescent outputs, or bioactive small molecules. Furthermore, cellular nucleic acids (mRNA or miRNA) have been harnessed to promote assemblies and reactions in live cells. The tolerance of PNA synthesis also lends itself to the encoding of small molecules that can be further assembled on the basis of their nucleic acid sequences. It is now well-established that hybridization-based assemblies displaying two or more ligands can interact synergistically with a target biomolecule. These assemblies have now been shown to be functional in vivo. Similarly, PNA-tagged macromolecules have been used to prepare bioactive assemblies and three-dimensional nanostructures. Several technologies based on DNA-templated synthesis of sequence-defined polymers or DNA-templated display of ligands have been shown to be compatible with reiterative cycles of selection\/amplification starting with large libraries of DNA templates, bringing the power of in vitro evolution to synthetic molecules and offering the possibility of exploring uncharted molecular diversity space with unprecedented scope and speed.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Hierarchical porous carbon microrods composed of vertically aligned graphene-like nanosheets for Li-ion batteries","Abstract":"Preventing the stacking of ultrathin 2D carbon nanostructures is a very important research theme in the field of energy storage. In this work, hierarchical porous carbon microrods (HPCMs) composed of vertically aligned graphene-like nanosheets are successfully fabricated via a facile Mg(OH)(2)-templating method. The unique structure of the HPCMs is a desirable combination of 1D hierarchical structures, vertically aligned graphenes, and porous graphenes. With the hierarchical structure and pores, high specific surface area, large pore volume, and ideal charge transport and ion diffusion pathways, HPCMs are potential candidates for high-performance electrode materials. When used as an anode for Li-ion batteries, the HPCM electrode exhibits excellent capability (1150 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)), rate performance (246 mA h g(-1) at 10 A g(-1)), and cycling stability (833 mA h g(-1) after 700 cycles at 1 A g(-1)), with measurements superior to those of natural graphite and many graphene-based anodes.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"A green method to increase yield and quality of bio-oil: ultrasonic pretreatment of biomass and catalytic upgrading of bio-oil over metal (Cu, Fe and\/or Zn)\/gamma-Al2O3","Abstract":"A green method is developed to increase the yield and quality of bio-oil by ultrasonic pretreatment of biomass followed by in situ catalytic upgrading of bio-oil over metal (Cu, Fe and\/or Zn)\/gamma-Al2O3. It is found that the yield of bio-oil is increased up to 10 wt% after cedar is pretreated by ultrasound before pyrolysis. Various metals (Cu, Fe and Zn) are loaded on gamma-Al2O3 and applied for upgrading the bio-oil derived from the pyrolysis of pretreated cedar. It is found that the catalysts promote the conversion of oxygenated compounds into aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. In particular, production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene is favored. The best catalytic activity is achieved by using 2.5 wt% Zn\/gamma-Al2O3 with a maximum hydrocarbon yield of 80.3%. The catalyst is reused for up to four cycles. The results show that the catalysts after regeneration by calcination at 550 degrees C for 30 min exhibit long-term stability for upgrading of bio-oil.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Effect of carbonization temperature on properties of aligned electrospun polyacrylonitrile carbon nanofibers","Abstract":"Aligned electrospun nanofibrous bundle was used as the raw material for pretreatment, preoxidation and carbonization processes to prepare carbon nanofibers in a procedure temperature-controlled sintering furnace.

This Accounts of Chemical Research thematic issue on \"Synthesis, Design, and Molecular Function\" is intended to provide further perspective now from well into the 21st century. Much has happened in the past few decades. The targets, methods, strategies, reagents, procedures, goals, funding, practices, and practitioners of synthesis have changed, some in dramatic ways as documented in impressive contributions to this issue. However, a constant for most synthesis studies continues to be the goal of achieving function with synthetic economy. -Whether in the form of new catalysts, reagents, therapeutic leads, diagnostics, drug delivery systems, imaging agents, sensors, materials, energy generation and storage systems, bioremediation strategies, or molecules that challenge old theories or test new ones, the function of a target has been and continues to be a major and compelling justification for its synthesis. While the targets of synthesis have historically been heavily represented by natural products, increasingly design, often inspired by natural structures, is providing a new source of target structures exhibiting new or natural functions and new or natural synthetic challenges. Complementing isolation and screening approaches to new target identification, design enables one to create targets de novo with an emphasis on sought-after function and synthetic innovation with step-economy. Design provides choice. It allows one to determine how close a synthesis will come to the ideal synthesis and how close a structure will come to the ideal function. In this Account, we address studies in our laboratory on function-oriented synthesis (FOS), a strategy to achieve function by design and with synthetic economy. By starting with function rather than structure, FOS places an initial emphasis on target design, thereby harnessing the power of chemists and computers to create new structures with desired functions that could be prepared in a simple, safe, economical, and green, if not ideal, fashion. Reported herein are examples of FOS associated with (a) molecular recognition, leading to the first designed phorbol-inspired protein ldnase C regulatory ligands, the first designed bryostatin analogs, the newest bryologs, and a new family of designed kinase inhibitors, (b) target modification, leading to highly simplified but functionally competent photonucleases-molecules that cleave DNA upon photoactivation, (c) drug delivery, leading to cell penetrating molecular transporters, molecules that ferry other attached or complexed molecules across biological barriers, and (d). new reactivity-regenerating reagents in the form of functional equivalents of butatrienes, reagents that allow for back-to-back three-component cycloaddition reactions, thus achieving structural complexity and value with step-economy. While retrosynthetic analysis seeks to identify the best way to make a target, retrofunction analysis seeks to identify the best targets to make. In essence, form (structure) follows function.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Freezing-induced multi-colour emissions of AIE luminogen di(4-propoxyphenyl) dibenzofulvene","Abstract":"This work reports the freezing-induced emission change of di(4-propoxyphenyl) dibenzofulvene (DBF) molecules, which exhibit unusual aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and crystallization-induced emission enhancement (CIEE) effects. DBF powders in both amorphous (orange) and crystalline (yellow and green) states undergo rapid reversible shifts in their maximum emission wavelengths (lambda(em)) during the freezing-thawing (F-T) process. When the acetonitrile\/water DBF dispersions emitting orange or yellow colours are F-T treated, their emissions change to green. Moreover, the DBF dispersions containing poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and acrylamide (AAm) undergo gradual and more significant blue-shift in lambda(em) with F-T cycles, and further blue-shifts in lambda(em) are found when F-T treated dispersions are gelated or just kept for some time. The emission change of the DBF dispersions with the F-T process and the after-treatment is confirmed to be due to the change of their aggregation morphologies. DBF dispersions and hydrogels with different emission colours are obtained, and the luminescent hydrogels exhibit excellent mechanical properties. This study reveals a new freezing-induced emission change of AIE substances and provides a simple method for preparing hydrogels emitting different colours by using one luminogen.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Development of Biomimetic Tilapia Collagen Nanofibers for Skin Regeneration through Inducing Keratinocytes Differentiation and Collagen Synthesis of Dermal Fibroblasts (Retracted article.

The collagen sponge was composed of at least two a-peptides, and its denaturation temperature was 44.99 degrees C. It did not change the number of spleen-derived lymphocytes in BALB\/c mice, the ratio of CD4(+)\/CD8(+) lymphocytes, and the level of IgG or IgM in Sprague-Dawley rat. The contact angle, tensile strength, and weight loss temperature of collagen nanofibers were 21.2 degrees, 6.72 +\/- 0.44 MPa, and 300 degrees C, respectively. The nanofibers could promote the viabilities of human keratinocytes (HaCaTs) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), inducing epidermal differentiation through the gene expression of involucrin, filaggrin, and type I transglutaminase of HaCaTs, and they could also accelerate migration of HaCaTs with the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). Besides, the nanofibers could upregulate the protien level of Col-I in HDFs both via a direct effect and TGF-beta 1 secreted from HaCaTs, thus facilitating the formation of collagen fibers. Furthermore, the collagen nanofibers stimulated the skin regeneration rapidly and effectively in vivo. These biological effects could be explained as the contributions from the biomimic extracellular cell matrix structure, hydrophilicity, and the multiple amino acids of the collagen nanofibers.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Will it gel? Successful computational prediction of peptide gelators using physicochemical properties and molecular fingerprints","Abstract":"The self-assembly of low molecular weight gelators to form gels has enormous potential for cell culturing, optoelectronics, sensing, and for the preparation of structured materials. There is an enormous \"chemical space\" of gelators. Even within one class, functionalised dipeptides, there are many structures based on both natural and unnatural amino acids that can be proposed and there is a need for methods that can successfully predict the gelation propensity of such molecules. We have successfully developed computational models, based on experimental data, which are robust and are able to identify in silico dipeptide structures that can form gels. A virtual computational screen of 2025 dipeptide candidates identified 9 dipeptides that were synthesised and tested. Every one of the 9 dipeptides synthesised and tested were correctly predicted for their gelation properties. This approach and set of tools enables the \"dipeptide space\" to be searched effectively and efficiently in order to deliver novel gelator molecules.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"An assessment of hot metal fragments from heavy mechanical equipment as a potential ignition source for forest litter","Abstract":"The presence of metal particles, produced by rock strikes with heavy mechanical equipment, has come to be considered as evidence of fire causation in the investigation of forest fires.

The eletrospinning manufacturing is one of the most widely reported methods for nanofiber (NF) manufacturing, providing security, high quality and productivity. In spite of the first patent about electrospinning has been applied in April 5th, 1900 by John Francis Cooley, a historical perspective (since 1600s) about this amazing discovery represents an important step for future applications. Nanofibers have been considered one of the top interesting fundamental study objects for academicians, and greatest intriguing business materials for modern industry. As a consequence, lucrative organizations and companies have explored the relevance of nanofibers. In this paper, the quantity of published manuscripts and patent inventions is presented and the correlation of research activities to the production of new electrospinning materials is shown. China and the United States have been leading in electrospinning and nanofibers development. The company triumph is mostly dependent on applications improvement relevant for broader business society. A dramatic rise of interest in nanofibers produced by electrospinning technique has been confirmed due to the publication data, author's affiliation, keywords, and essential characterization procedures. Is has been shown that the number of publications on electrospinning and nanofibers researches from academic institutions is higher than industrial laboratories. More than 1,891 patents using the term \"electrospinning\" and 2,960 with the term \"nanofibers\" according to the European Patent Office at title or abstract have been filed around the world up to 2013.

The use of BDNDC as a matrix to embed metal oxide nanoparticles has seldom been reported, even though such composites may possess the merits of both components to suit a broad range of applications. Inspired by the recipes used to bake cakes, we demonstrate here an external water-free synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles embedded in a BDNDC matrix, in which a foam of chicken egg white and Ti(SO4)(2) is obtained simply by beating with a domestic electric whisk and subsequently annealed under a reducing atmosphere at different temperatures. Anatase-BDNDC, anatase\/rutile-BDNDC and TiO2(B)\/rutile-BDNDC samples are obtained at 550, 720, and 880 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, the obtained TiO2-BDNDC composites can be used as anode material for lithium-ion batteries and also exhibit high performance.

In this Account, we summarize the strategies for making a variety of self-supported noble metal aerogels consisting of extended metal backbone nanonetworks. We discuss their outstanding physical and chemical properties, including their three-dimensional network structure, the simple control over their composition, their large specific surface area, and their hierarchical porosity. Additionally, we show some initial results on their excellent performance as electrocatalysts combining both high catalytic activity and high durability for fuel cell reactions such as ethanol oxidation and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Finally, we give some hints on the future challenges in the research area of metal aerogels. We believe that metal aerogels are a new, promising class of electrocatalysts for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) and will also open great opportunities for other electrochemical energy systems, catalysis, and sensors. The commercialization of PEFCs encounters three critical obstacles, viz., high cost, insufficient activity, and inadequate long-term durability. Besides others, the sluggish kinetics of the ORR and alcohol oxidation and insufficient catalyst stability are important reasons for these obstacles. Various approaches have been taken to overcome these obstacles, e.g., by controlling the catalyst particle size in an optimized range, forming multimetallic catalysts, controlling the surface compositions, shaping the catalysts into nanocrystals, and designing supportless catalysts with extended surfaces such as nanostructured thin films, nanotubes, and porous nanostructures. These efforts have produced plenty of excellent electrocatalysts, but the development of multisynergetic functional catalysts exhibiting low cost, high activity, and high durability still faces great challenges. In this Account, we demonstrate that the sol-gel process represents a powerful bottom-up strategy for creating nanostructured materials that tackles the problems mentioned above. Aerogels are unique solid materials with ultralow densities, large open pores, and ultimately high inner surface areas. They magnify the specific properties of nanomaterials to the macroscale via self-assembly, which endow them with superior properties. Despite numerous investigations of metal oxide aerogels, the investigation of metal aerogels is in the early stage. Recently, aerogels including Fe, Co, Ni, Sn, and Cu have been obtained by nanosmelting of hybrid polymer-metal oxide aerogels. We report here exclusively on mono-, bi- and multimetallic noble metal aerogels consisting of Ag, Au, Pt, and Pd and their application as electrocatalysts.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Electrospun polymer nanofibers of P(NIPAAm-co-SA-co-FBPY): Preparation, structural control, metal ion sensing and thermoresponsive characteristics","Abstract":"Multifunctional electrospun (ES) nanofibers prepared from random copolymers of poly{(N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-(stearyl acid)-co-[9,9-dihexylfluorene-2-bipyridine-7-(4-vinylphenyl)]) (poly (NIPAAm-co-SA-co-FBPY) were successfully prepared from the electrospinning technique with a singlecapillary spinneret. FBPY demonstrated blue or red shift in emission wavelength and fluorescence quenching when chelating with different metal ions. With appropriate composition of SA in the copolymer, films and nanofibers could maintain their morphology in aqueous solution at different thermal treatments. Polymers in three states, solution, film and nanofiber, were prepared and their effects on sensing ability were investigated. The smooth nanofibers prepared from P2 (with copolymer composition of NIPAAm:SA:FBPY = 93:6:1) demonstrated superior sensitivity as low as 10(-5) M in sensing zinc ions as compared to polymer films (10(-3) M) due to the high specific surface area of nanofibers. The porous nanofibers of P2 were also manufactured to further enhance sensing performance and showed the best sensitivity (10(-6) M) among three states when sensing with zinc ions (sensitivitY of polymer solution in THF was about 10(-5) M). These nanofibers also exhibit an interesting \"on\/off' switch behavior with decreasing temperature from 40 to 10 degrees C due to the hydrophobic-hydrophilic transition of NIPAAm moieties which cause the gradual swelling of nanofibers. These results indicated that the new nanofibers could have potential applications in multifunctional sensory devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ZnO doped strontium-natural nanoferrites of composition (80 - x) Fe2O3:xZnO:20SrCO(3), where x = 0, 10, 20 mol% are synthesized and sintered via the solid state reaction scheme. Samples are characterized by SEM, XRD, VSM, and VNA measurements to determine the impact of ZnO contents' variation on the surface morphology, structure, magnetic and microwave absorption properties. The Nicolson-Ross-Weir method is applied to evaluate samples' reflection loss. The average grain size of the strontium ferrite is found to reduce with the increase in ZnO concentration. Materials sintered at 1100 degrees C without ZnO incorporation are composed of hexagonal SrFe12O19. Meanwhile, the addition of ZnO produces cubic ZnFe2O4 and SrFeO2 phases. Insertion of ZnO results in reduction of magnetic parameters and reflection loss. Furthermore, the anisotropy magnetic field of strontium natural ferrites displays a rapid drop from 350 kA\/m to 79.6 kA\/m with the increase in ZnO. Strontium ferrite containing 20 mol% of ZnO exhibits superior microwave absorption with reflection loss within -45 dB to -55.94 dB in the frequency range of 7-13 GHz.

CXCR2 and its ligand, CXCL8, are implicated in a number of inflammation-mediated diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and cancer. Though the development of CXCR2-specific small-molecule inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents has been pursued by pharmaceutical companies within the past decade, there are currently no clinically approved CXCR2 inhibitors. A pharmacophore model based on previously reported CXCR2 antagonists was developed to screen a database of commercially available compounds. Small-molecule compounds identified from the pharmacophore screening were selected for in vitro screening in a cell-based CXCR2-mediated beta-arrestin-2 recruitment assay and further characterized in several cell-based assays and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation studies in mice. CX compounds identified from pharmacophore modeling inhibited cell migration, lung and colon cancer cell proliferation, and colony formation. Mechanistic studies of CX4152 showed that this compound inhibits CXCR2 signaling through downregulation of surface CXCR2. Additionally, CX4152 significantly inhibits CXCL8-mediated neutrophil migration and LPS-induced lung inflammation in mice. Using a CXCR2-inhibitor-based pharmacophore model, we identified a novel set of sulfonamides from a diverse library of small molecules.

When the swollen hydrogel collapses in an oil-filled channel, the incorporated water and molecules are expelled from the hydrogel and form a water reservoir. Water-in-oil droplets can be released from the reservoir generating different sized droplets depending on the flow regime at various oil flow rates (dispensing functionality). Different hydrogel sizes and microfluidic structures are discussed in terms of their storage and droplet formation capabilities.

Indeed, the in vivo fate guides the adaptation of their chemical structure and formulation to increase their transfection capacity while maintaining their tolerance. With this goal, lipidic fluorescent probes were synthesized and formulated with cationic lipophosphoramidate KLN47 (KLN: Karine Le Ny). We found that such formulations present constant compaction properties and similar transfection results without inducing additional cytotoxicity. Next, biodistribution profiles of pegylated and unpegylated lipoplexes were compared after systemic injection in mice. Pegylation of complexes led to a prolonged circulation in the bloodstream, whereas their in vivo bioluminescent expression profiles were similar. Moreover, systemic administration of pegylated lipoplexes resulted in a transient liver toxicity. These results indicate that these new fluorescent compounds could be added into lipoplexes in small amounts without perturbing the transfection capacities of the formulations.

The effects of the concentrations of the metal salt and GO sheets used to prepare the nanoparticle-decorated GO, the internal phase fraction, and the type of oil phase on the formation and properties of HIPEs were systematically investigated. The results showed that the intermediate GO concentration used to prepare the nanoparticle-decorated GO was helpful for the formation of HIPE. And the average diameter of HIPE droplets decreased with the increase in the concentration of metal salt (iron chloride), but enhanced with the increase in the internal phase fraction. Oils with a large viscosity or containing a benzene ring structure were favorable to forming concentrated emulsions with a high internal phase fraction. Furthermore, the nanoparticle-decorated GO stabilized Pickering HIPE was used as a template to prepare functional GO-based porous foams by polymerizing the Pickering HIPE. This research paves a facile and effective way for the fabrication of functional GO-based O\/W Pickering HIPEs and porous materials, which may find a wide variety of applications, such as in magnetic, catalytic and electrochemical fields.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Multifunctional triboelectric nanogenerator based on porous micro-nickel foam to harvest mechanical energy","Abstract":"To strengthen the effective contact area of two materials with the opposite triboelectric polarities was proved to be an effective solution to enhance the electronic output of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). Presently, that mainly focused on the surface modification of negative materials by micro\/nano structure, however, rarely for the positive materials. Here, we presented a simple, low-cost and multifunctional TENG based on the porous micro-nickel foam (PMNF) for harvesting the natural vibration energy. With the surface modification of PMNF with the positive polarity, the newly designed TENG produced an open-circuit voltage up to 187.8 V and a short-circuit current of 71.9 mu A with the peak power density of 3.7 W\/m(2) at the resonance frequency of 13.9 Hz by harvesting vibration energy. This TENG could simultaneously and continuously light up 100 commercial light-emitting diode bulbs. Additionally, by the footfalls force of about 500 N, the corresponding open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current were as high as 403 V and 336 mu A, respectively. The newly designed TENG can be used for the self-powdered floor by footfalls and also for powering some wireless electronics by harvesting the vibration energy from highways, railways, and tunnels in remote mountain areas.

The grafting reaction and cross-linked structure of the hybrid material were investigated using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the equilibrium swelling method. The analysis results indicated that the carboxyl group of [(HOOC)C(1)C(1)Im][NTf2] can react with the epoxy group of ENR 50 to generate an ENR 50-[(HOOC) C(1)C(1)Im][NTf2] graft polymer under conditions of 40 degrees C for 24 h. Furthermore, the grafting of ENR 50 formed ionic clusters and led to ionic crosslinking.

However, it is difficult to apply CPT clinically, because of its poor water solubility and reversible instability between the active lactone and inactive carboxylate forms at neutral pH. In this paper, to overcome these limitations, the active lactone form of CPT-soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) complex self-assembled nanoparticles (CPT-SPC NPs) is prepared by a co-solvent method combined with a self-assembly technique. The CPT-SPC complex is characterized by solubility, UV-vis, H-1 NMR, FTIR, XRD, and fluorescence analysis. These results prove the efficient complexation between active lactone form of CPT and SPC (complexation rate was high as approximately 98%). The self-assembled CPT-SPC NPs show a hydrodynamic particle size of 210.7 +\/- 6.1 nm, a zeta potential of -24.9 +\/- 3.1 mV, a spherical shape, and a high drug-loading content of 16.3 +\/- 0.5%. CPT is released from the CPT-SPC NPs in a biphasic way with an initial burst release followed by a subsequent sustained release. Additionally, in comparision with the free CPT, the CPT-SPC NPs, because of the improved drug stability and enhanced drug transport across cellular membranes, present significantly higher cellular uptake efficiency and cell-killing effect of the drug. Moreover, both confocal imaging and fluorescence measurements demonstrate that CPT is able to be delivered to nuclei by the CPT-SPC NPs after their cellular uptake, by real-time monitoring of drug release and intracellular drug delivery. Furthermore, in vivo animal imaging results indicate that the systemically administered CPT-SPC NPs exhibit excellent tumor targetability in HeLa tumor-bearing nude mice. These results demonstrate that the CPT-SPC complex-based self-assembled NPs hold great potential as effective drug delivery systems for cancer treatment.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Improvements in thermo-mechanical and rheological properties of SiO2\/epoxy composites using different types of SiO2","Abstract":"Single-size 400 nm-SiO2 and multi-size 1 and 5 mu m-SiO2 were used as fillers in epoxy matrix.

Previous work from our lab and others show the versatility of this platform to deliver large doses of physico-chemically diverse agents. However, there is still an unmet need to develop practical fiber formulations for water-soluble small molecule drugs needed at high dosing due to intrinsic low potency or desire for sustained prevention. To date, most sustained release fibers have been restricted to the delivery of biologics or hydrophobic small molecules at low drug loading of typically <1 wt.%, which is often impractical for most clinical applications. For hydrophilic small molecule drugs, their high aqueous solubility and poor partitioning and incompatibility with insoluble polymers make long-term release even more challenging. Here we investigate several existing strategies to sustain release of hydrophilic small molecule drugs that are highly-loaded in electrospun fibers. In particular, we investigate what is known about the design constraints required to realize multi-day release from fibers fabricated from uniaxial and coaxial electrospinning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The adsorption mechanism of polysorbate 80 on nanoparticles is not known due to a lack of suitable techniques for quantification at low concentrations. Here we report the probable mechanism of polysorbate 80 adsorption on poly-D, L-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles using a novel extraction procedure coupled with a highly sensitive attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopic method. Both methods facilitated the characterization and quantification of extracted surfactant at the nanogram level. Adsorption isotherm modeling reveals that polysorbate 80 follows a physisorption process (Delta G = 38 kJ Mol(-1)) and forms a monolayer on the nanoparticle surface. Thermal analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further support polysorbate 80 coating and surface coverage on PLGA nanoparticles. Real-time ATR-FTIR analysis shows that polysorbate 80 interacts with nanoparticles through the ester group (-C=O) and acyl chain (-CH2) during the adsorption. The extent and direction of band shifts in real-time FTIR experiments suggest that the acyl chain of polysorbate 80 micelles loses its ordered structure and becomes flexible with a higher gauche\/trans conformer ratio. Reduction in the degree of hydration of the ester group indicates an increase in hydrophobic interactions in the presence of PLGA nanoparticles. The results of FTIR analysis states that polysorbate 80 acquires a flat structure on the nanoparticle surface. This study on polysorbate 80 quantification and adsorption with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy can be extended to other non-ionic surfactants which will ultimately help in determination of biological fate of surfactant coated nanoparticles under in vivo conditions.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Control of the plasmonic resonance of a graphene coated plasmonic nanoparticle array combined with a nematic liquid crystal","Abstract":"We report on the fabrication and characterization of a switchable plasmonic device based on a conductive graphene oxide (cGO) coated plasmonic nanoparticle (NP) array, layered with nematic liquid crystal (NLC) as an active medium.

This monolayer is then coated with a thin (less then 100nm) cGO film which acts simultaneously as both an electro-conductive and active medium. The combination of the conductive NP array with a separate top cover substrate having both cGO and a standard LC alignment layer is used for aligning a NLC film in a hybrid configuration. The system is analysed in terms of morphological and electro-optical properties. The spectral response of the sample characterized after each element is added (air, cGO, NLC) reveals a red-shift of the localized plasmonic resonance (LPR) frequency of approximately 62nm with respect to the NP array surrounded by air. The application of an external voltage (8Vpp) is suitable to modulate (blue shift) the LPR frequency by approximately 22nm. (C) 2016 Author(s).

However, it is required to fill the gap between the promises of any new functionalized SPIONs and the effects of these coatings on the NPs safety. Nanotoxicology is offering diverse strategies to assess the effect of exposure to SPIONs in a case-by-case manner but an integrated nanoimpact scale has not been developed yet. We have implemented the classical integrated biological response (IBR) into an integrated nanoimpact index (INI) as an early warning scale of nano-impact based on a combination of toxicological end points such as cell proliferation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and genotoxicity. Here, the effect of SPIONs functionalized with tri-sodium citrate (TSC), polyethylenimine (PEI), aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES) and Chitosan (chitosan) were assessed on human keratinocytes and endothelial cells. Our results show that endothelial cells were more sensitive to exposure than keratinocytes and the initial cell culture density modulated the toxicity. PEI-SPIONs had the strongest effects in both cell types while TSC-SPIONS were the most biocompatible. This study emphasizes not only the importance of surface coatings but also the cell type and the initial cell density on the selection of toxicity assays. The INI developed here could offer an initial rationale to choose either modifying SPIONs properties to reduce its nanoimpact or performing a complete risk assessment to define the risk boundaries.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"In-situ TEM examination and exceptional long-term cyclic stability of ultrafine Fe3O4 nanocrystal\/carbon nanofiber composite electrodes","Abstract":"Scalable synthesis of electrode materials with long cyclic life, high energy and power densities is a prerequisite for next-generation Li ion batteries. Freestanding composite films are prepared by one-pot electrospinning, in which ultrafine Fe3O4 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in a continuous carbon nanofiber (CNF) matrix. The Fe3O4\/CNF electrodes deliver remarkable electrochemical performance, e.g. a reversible capacity of 881 mA hg(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1), excellent cyclic stability of 687 rnA h g(-1) after 350 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1) and a high-rate capability of 422 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 5.0 A g(-1) with 84% capacity retention. These values are among the highest ever reported for various nanostructured iron oxide-based electrodes. Even after prolonged cycles, the CNF matrix containing ultrafine nanocrystals remains structurally sound without damage. In contrast, the Fe3O4\/CNF-750 electrode containing larger Fe3O4 particles obtained at a higher carbonization temperature of 750 degrees C presents faster capacity decay and cracking of CNF matrix due to larger volume expansion. The in-situ TEM analysis is used to provide an insight into real-time structural evolution and conversion reactions It is revealed that (i) upon initial lithiation, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles embedded in the CNF are gradually reduced to Fe nanograins along the Li ion diffusion direction; and (ii) after clelithiation, a new oxidation product, FeO, emerges, instead of Fe3O4. The irreversible phase conversion from Fe3O4 to Fe is the first of its kind reported for Fe3O4 electrodes although a similar phenomenon has been proposed for other electrode materials, like Fe2O3 and Co3O4.

This makes them a popular target for investigation of peptide-lipid interactions. Here we report the effect of melittin, an important antimicrobial peptide, on the dynamics of membranes based on 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) lipid in both the solid gel and fluid phases. To probe the phase transition, elastic neutron intensity temperature scans have been carried out on DMPC-based unilamellar vesicles (ULV) with and without melittin. We have found that addition of a small amount (0.2 mol%) melittin eliminates the steep fall in the elastic intensity at 296 K associated with the solid gel to fluid phase transition, which is observed for pure DMPC vesicles. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) experiments have been carried out on DMPC ULV in the solid gel and fluid phases with and without 0.2 mol% melittin. The data analysis invariably shows the presence of lateral and internal motions of the DMPC molecule. We found that melittin does have a profound effect on the dynamics of lipid molecules, especially on the lateral motion, and affects it in a different way, depending on the phase of the bilayers. In the solid gel phase, it acts as a plasticizer, enhancing the lateral motion of DMPC. However, in the fluid phase it acts as a stiffening agent, restricting the lateral motion of the lipid molecules. These observations are consistent with the mean squared displacements extracted from the elastic intensity temperature scans. Their importance lies in the fact that many membrane processes, including signaling and energy transduction pathways, are controlled to a great extent by the lateral diffusion of lipids in the membrane. To investigate the effect of melittin on vesicles supplemented with cholesterol, QENS experiments have also been carried out on DMPC ULV with cholesterol in the presence and absence of 0.2 mol% melittin. Remarkably, the effects of melittin on the membrane dynamics disappear in the presence of 20 mol% cholesterol. Our measurements indicate that the destabilizing effect of the peptide melittin on membranes can be mitigated by the presence of cholesterol. This study might provide new insights into the mechanism of action of antimicrobial peptides and their selective toxicity towards foreign microorganisms.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Free-standing, flexible thermochromic films based on one-dimensional magnetic photonic crystals","Abstract":"We have in this paper developed a simple, one-step strategy to fabricate free-standing, flexible thermochromic films at a centimeter scale by the instant free radical polymerization of a sterically stabilized magnetically responsive photonic crystal (MRPC) nonaqueous suspension containing N-isopropyl acrylamide under an external magnetic field (H).

Since the PNIPAM matrix has a much smaller refractive index than that of the Fe3O4@PVP CNC particles, and may remarkably change its volume and thus the lattice constants with temperature, the as-prepared thermochromic 1D PC films can display bright iridescent colors which are obviously sensitive to temperature with good reversibility and durability even when the volume fraction of the Fe3O4@PVP CNC particles is as low as 0.1 vol%. For example, the blue-shift range for the diffraction wavelength can reach up to 140 nm when temperature increases from 10 to 35 degrees C.

Moreover, a large number of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) decorated using HPG as templates could also enable the N-CNTs\/Ag sponges to possess linear current-voltage behavior. Furthermore, the Ag NPs on the compartmental films can be considered as interlocked nanodomes, which not only enhance compression stress but also generate huge variation of resistance through variation of contact area under mechanical deformation. These novel designs featuring interlocked geometry and covalent bonding allow the hybrid sponges to act as strain-gauge sensors with high gauge factor (1.4) and excellent stability.

On the other hand the regenerated fibers have reduced sheet-forming-properties and induce problems by the appearance of so-called \"stickies\". These substances are undesirable components, since reduced and in some cases interfere with the action of the cationic chemical additives (CCA) added for a specific purpose. To solve these issues papermakers use CCA. What is used primarily in the paper production processes are high-molecular weight hydrophilic synthetic polymers (polyelectrolytes) with different chemical nature. As a result, the dewatering is accelerated, the retention of the components in the paper sheet is improved and this provides a clarified white waters. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of cationic synthetic polyelectrolytes with different chemical nature and charge over the behavior during the dewatering of paper furnish from recycled fiber material from waste paper. The recycled fiber material is from waste newsprint paper and it mainly consists of chemical-thermomechanical pulp. Six types of cationic chemical additives with different chemical nature and charge density are used. The dewatering ability is measured and the turbidity and conductivity of the white waters is determined. As a result of the studies carried out it is found out that for the improvement of the dewatering and for the clarification of the white waters, the most advisable is the usage of chemical additive based on polyacrylamide.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Filter paper derived cross-linked interconnected BaBi0.2Co0.35Fe0.45O3-delta morphology with an enhanced oxygen permeation property","Abstract":"This study aims to investigate the effect of an engineered microstructure on the oxygen permeation property of a BaBi0.2Co0.35Fe0.45O3-delta (BBCF) type perovskite membrane. The interconnected multi-level cross-linked structure of the BBCF membrane has been synthesized by mimicking a common laboratory grade filter paper. The controlled calcination of the cellulose matrix results in a single phase BBCF structure when calcined at 950 degrees C in air. The average diameter of the interconnected BBCF fiber is about 1 mu m as confirmed by FESEM. The electrical conductivity is measured to be similar to 20 S cm(-1) at 800 degrees C, higher than that of other conventionally prepared BBCF based membranes.

The macromolecular crosslinks undergo scission, recoiling and re-crosslinking. The process continues until the temperature decreases below the chemorheological temperature. The material now has modified properties (reduced stiffness) and permanent set on removal of the applied load. Cavitation and void growth in elastomers have been extensively studied when there is no scission and re-crosslinking. In this work, the problem is re-visited when the temperature exceeds the chemorheological temperature and changes occurs due to scission and re-crosslinking. The radial tension in the far field is fixed and the material changes with time due to scission and re-crosslinking. Thus, whereas previous work considered void growth under conditions of increasing radial tension and an unchanging material, this work considers a fixed radial load and an evolving material. The void is modeled as an initial small concentric spherical cavity in a large spherical body. The cavity surface is traction free and the outer surface is under radial tension. The material is modeled by a constitutive equation developed in earlier work that combines mechanical response with the kinetics of scission and re-crosslinking. A nonlinear Volterra integral equation is established for the time dependence of the void radius. A condition is developed for determining the rate of growth of the void radius. It is shown to be a monitor that can determine a time when a significant event, such as unbounded void growth rate, occurs. Numerical examples are presented.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Graphene-based sorbents for iodine-129 capture and sequestration","Abstract":"The capture and sequestration of iodine-129 (I-129), a long-lived byproduct of nuclear fission, is essential to the implementation of advanced nuclear fuel cycles and effective nuclear waste management. Current state-of-the-art technologies inherently require silver to bind iodine, e.g., silver-loaded silica aerogels or silver-loaded zeolite (AgZ), which are very expensive and an environmental concern. It is highly desirable to develop alternative costeffective adsorbents for iodine capture and sequestration. Herein, we report graphenebased nanomaterials including graphene powder and graphene aerogel as novel iodine sorbents showing exceptional adsorption capability and kinetics. By measuring iodine sorption capacities and uptake rates in an I-2(g) saturated environment, graphene sorbents display impressive iodine sorption capacities with powdered samples achieving mass gains in excess of 85 mass%, and aerogels exceeding 100% mass gains. A direct correlation among specific surface area, defect concentration, and maximum sorption capacity has been established, and the sorption kinetics of the graphene for iodine capture was determined.

An ideal scaffold should mimic the organic and inorganic compositions of bone. Here, CaCO3\/casein microspheres were encapsulated in PCL composite membranes using cosolvent electrospinning to mimic the hierarchical structure and composition of bone ECM. As PCL lacks functional groups to support cell adhesion, gelatin was grafted onto membranes. To find the optimum composition, CaCO3\/casein microspheres were entrapped at five different concentrations. Various analytical techniques, including FTIR, XRD, SEM and EDS, were applied to characterize the particles and membranes. The CaCO3\/casein microparticles were spheres of similar to 1 mm, mainly in vaterite form. The amount of casein was 23.9 +\/- 1% determined by BCA assay and its presence stabilized CaCO3 in vaterite. After surface modification, the hydrophilicity of membranes was improved while the membrane morphology was not significantly changed; on the membranes, both gelatin and CaCO3\/casein microspheres were evenly distributed. Due to the presence of vaterite, the biomineralization property of a composite membrane was significantly enhanced. Furthermore, we compared HMSC proliferation on composite membranes with FDA staining and MTT assay. After cells were cultured in osteogenic medium, differentiation potential was investigated by analyzing gene expressions of RUNX2, COL-I and ALP, and monitoring ALP activity. Presence of CaCO3\/casein microspheres enhanced cell proliferation and differentiation, especially sample P-20 which demonstrated better potential to be used in bone tissue engineering than others.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Physicochemical Characterization of Functional Lignin-Silica Hybrid Fillers for Potential Application in Abrasive Tools","Abstract":"Functional lignin-SiO2 hybrid fillers were prepared for potential application in binders for phenolic resins, and their chemical structure was characterized. The properties of these fillers and of composites obtained from them with phenolic resin were compared with those of systems with lignin or silica alone. The chemical structure of the materials was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (C-13 CP MAS NMR). The thermal stability of the new functional fillers was examined by thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TG-MS). Thermo-mechanical properties of the lignin-silica hybrids and resin systems were investigated by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The DMTA results showed that abrasive composites with lignin-SiO2 fillers have better thermo-mechanical properties than systems with silica alone. Thus, fillers based on lignin might provide new, promising properties for the abrasive industry, combining the good properties of lignin as a plasticizer and of silica as a filler improving mechanical properties.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Nickel nanocomposites: magnetic and catalytic properties","Abstract":"In this study, we are reporting the synthesis and characterization of nanocomposites obtained from the direct reduction of nickel(II) salts on matrices of polyethylene (Pe) and chitosan (Ch) in the presence of serine under solvothermal conditions.

The synthesized composites were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction techniques; in all the cases, the peaks associated to the matrix (Pe or Ch) and three peaks at 2 theta values of 44.5 degrees, 51.9 degrees, 76.4 degrees were identified, which correspond to the Miller indices (111), (200), (220). These indices are characteristic of a face centred cubic Ni-0 phase. The SEM images of the composites show that the use of an organic matrix changes the size and distribution of the metallic particles because in all the cases a homogenous dispersion of Ni-0-NPs on the matrix surfaces is observed. While the spherical shape observed for isolated Ni-0-NPs is retained on the matrices, the size of the metallic particles is smaller than 100 nm with less size variability, as compared with the isolated Ni-0-NPs. All the composites have a weak ferromagnetic behaviour with similar hysteresis loops, presenting H-c values ranging from 120 to 226 Oe and reaching saturation at approximately 3 kOe.

However, typical micro- and nanofibers are usually free-standing or positioned on a substrate with lower refractive index to ensure the light confinement and guiding mode. Here we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the possibility of confining light within a microfiber on a high refractive index substrate. In contrast to the strong leakage to the substrate, we found that the radiation loss was dependent on the radius of the microfiber and the refractive index contrast. Consequently, quasi-guiding modes could be formed and the light could propagate and be amplified in such systems. By fabricating a tapered silica fiber and dye-doped polymer fiber and placing them on sapphire substrates, the light propagation, amplification, and consequent laser behaviors have been experimentally studied to verify the quasi-guiding modes in a microfiber on a higher index substrate.

ONE reacts more rapidly with nucleophilic amino acid side chains, resulting in covalent protein adducts, including residueresidue cross-links. Previously, we demonstrated that peptidylprolyl cis\/trans isomerase A1 (Pin1) was highly susceptible to adduction by HNE and that the catalytic cysteine (Cys113) was the preferential site of modification. Here, we show that ONE also preferentially adducts Pin1 at the catalytic Cys but results in a profoundly different modification. Results from experiments using purified Pin1 incubated with ONE revealed the principal product to be a Cys-Lys pyrrole-containing cross-link between the side chains of Cys113 and Lys117. In vitro competition assays between HNE and ONE demonstrate that ONE reacts more rapidly than HNE with Cys113. Exposure of RKO cells to alkynyl-ONE (aONE) followed by copper-mediated click chemistry and streptavidin purification revealed that Pin1 is also modified by ONE in cells. Analysis of the Pin1 crystal structure reveals that Cys113 and Lys117 are oriented toward each other in the active site, facilitating formation of an ONE cross-link.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Design and construction of three-dimensional CuO\/polyaniline\/rGO ternary hierarchical architectures for high performance supercapacitors","Abstract":"Rational design in terms of component and microstructure and fabrication of electrochemical electrodes are crucially important towards superior energy storage device.

LB-IONCs annealed at 773 K were found to be the most effective material (among its counterparts) for the removal of chlorazol black E, with an efficiency of 96.45% and a monolayer sequestration capacity of 40.02 mg g(-1).

The formation of glycyrrhizin (GL) capped gold nanoparticles was established by the presence of a surface plasmon resonance band at 523 nm. The as synthesized gold nanoparticles had a particle size of 17 +\/- 2 nm, with spherical shape and zeta potential value of -32 mV. GL-AuNPs showed excellent stability at varied pH, electrolyte conditions and cell culture media. The potential of synthesized gold nanoparticles as carrier of loaded antiviral drug lamivudine for liver targeting was explored. In vitro uptake studies by hepatocytes demonstrated a significant increase in cellular localization of GL-AuNPs as compared to citrate reduced gold nanoparticles (C-AuNPs). In vivo biodistribution study in Wistar rats proved the ability of GL-AuNPs for targeting liver. These finding can be utilized for site specific delivery of drugs for treatment of diseases affecting the liver.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Polydopamine-derived porous nanofibers as host of ZnFe2O4 nanoneedles: towards high-performance anodes for lithium-ion batteries","Abstract":"In this work, highly mesoporous carbon nanofibers in free-standing mat form are successfully fabricated by single-spinneret electrospinning of polystyrene (PS) followed by coating the porous PS nanofibers via in situ polymerization of dopamine and subsequent annealing. The pores inside the nanofibers are mainly in the range of 10-50 nm and interconnected to each other, forming nanochannels. ZnFe2O4 crystals can then be grown from the nanofibers via a solution route. Strikingly, ZnFe2O4 nanoneedles are formed, which have diameter and length of about 8 nm and 70 nm, respectively, and are located evenly not only on the surface of the nanofibers but also inside the nanochannels. The ZnFe2O4\/carbon composite nanofibers exhibit excellent cyclability and rate performance as anodes of lithium ion batteries (LIBs), in which the ZnFe2O4 nanoneedles are the major active component with normalized capacity of 1000-1700 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) and 560 mA h g(-1) at 5 A g(-1), respectively. The excellent properties can be ascribed to the very small diameter of the nanoneedles that ensures complete conversion reactions and alloying\/dealloying between Zn and lithium, the good contact of the nanoneedles with polydopamine-derived N-doped graphitic carbon that offer efficient electrical conduction, and the nanochannels that allow facile transport of the electrolyte and lithium ions.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Thin Layer Samples Controlled by Dynamic Electrochemistry","Abstract":"We summarize here recent advancements on thin layer samples controlled by dynamic electrochemistry techniques for determining different ions that include potassium, calcium, protamine, nitrate, nitrite and halides in diverse environmental and clinical samples. Generally, a thin layer liquid (less than 100 in thickness) is confined between a working electrode and an ion-selective membrane. Once an external electrical perturbation (i.e. constant potential) is applied to the system, an exhaustive ion transfer process is imposed in the entire thin layer solution. As a result, the observed charge (integration of the current decay) is proportional to the depleted ion concentration. Other electrochemical protocols such as linear sweep voltammetry were also explored aiming at the discrimination of several ions presented in the thin layer. One of the most attractive examples involves the detection of a mixture of three halides (iodide, bromide and chloride), which can be well resolved at moderated scan rates (10 mV.s(-1)). Paper-based coulometric sensing on thin layers defined by cellulose papers are being developed in view of translating these new concepts into a reliable and low cost sensing platform.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Valorization of Lignin Waste: Carbons from Hydrothermal Carbonization of Renewable Lignin as Superior Sorbents for CO2 and Hydrogen Storage","Abstract":"This report presents the preparation of renewable carbons from hydrothermally carbonized lignin waste. The hydrothermally carbonized mineral-free lignin-derived hydrochar was activated with KOH to yield carbons with surface area of 11573235 m(2) g-(1) and pore volume of 0.59-1.77 cm(3) g-(1). Activation at KOH\/carbon = 2, generates highly microporous carbons (>= 97% micropore surface area and 93% micropore volume), which exhibit excellent CO2 uptake capacity; up to 4.6 mmol g-(1) at 1 bar and 25 degrees C, and 17.3 mmol g-(1) at 20 bar and 25 degrees C, whereas at 0 degrees C and 1 bar, they store up to 7.4 mmol g-(1). Activation at KOH\/carbon = 4 can generate carbons with surface area and pore volume of up to 3235 m(2) g-(1) and 1.77 cm(3) g-(1), respectively, which have hydrogen uptake of up to 6.2 wt % at -196 degrees C and 20 bar. The simplicity of hydrothermal carbonization in generating hydrochars suitable for activation from readily available lignin waste, without the need for a demineralization step, makes these carbons attractive as gas storage materials for energy related applications.

In addition, a continuous flow of liquid is unable to generate a desired voltage, as it needs modification of the substrate such as development of nanopores and criss-cross network structures. Here, we report an ultra-low-cost yet highly efficient portable device for energy conversion, by exploiting the capillary flow of an electrolyte on a filter paper matrix in which a naturally deposited gradient of reduced graphene oxide is induced through chemical synthesis. In addition, the fibres and pores present in the paper offer a criss-cross network, acting as a natural splitter of a continuous flow into tiny droplets. Our methodology thus obviates the need for any elaborate procedure for pre-generation of droplets. Further, we fabricate the necessary electrodes on filter paper by simply scribing pencil tips on the same filter paper, which facilitates the necessary electrochemical reactions. Effectively, at the anode, electrons are released, which travel through the outer circuit for cation reduction at the cathode and deliver an electrical output (voltage\/current), realizing the conversion of the chemical form of energy to the electrical form in the filter paper. An absorbent pad at the channel outlet ensures continuous flow of fresh solution in the device, resulting in an inexpensive platform for power generation over a prolonged period of time. A maximum current density of 325 mA cm(-2) and a maximum power density of 53 mW cm(-2) have been observed, which significantly outweigh the capabilities of other reported devices fabricated for similar purposes.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Characterization of micro fibrillation process of cellulose and mercerized cellulose pulp","Abstract":"Here we detail the fibrillation process for cellulose and mercerized cellulose pulps. Native and mercerized cellulose showed a high degree of purity as indicated by alpha-cellulose content measurement and XRD analysis. Furthermore, a stark change in fiber morphology indicated aggregation of fibrils on the surface due to mercerization. Fibrillation of pulp was carried out in the following subsequent steps: Disintegration, PFI refining, microgrinding by 20 passes and 60 passes in a Super Mass Colloider respectively. Fiber samples were collected at every stage and highly uniform films were made by ultrafiltration and hot press method. The fibers and films made from fibers were then characterized by measuring physical properties, contact angle, thermal, mechanical, and SEM analysis. The main objective was to characterize the physical properties of the films made from different degrees of fibrillation. The films obtained were of fairly close grammage approximately 35 g m(-2). The target grammage was 40 g m(-2), and the slightly lower grammage indicated some fiber loss during the fabrication process. Additionally, it was observed that the density of the films increased with increasing degree of fibrillation from about 180 g m(-3) to 455 g m(-3) for cellulose I and 95 g m(-3) to 385 g m(-3) for cellulose II. Cellulose I films showed some contact angle to begin with which increased at every stage (14-64 degrees), whereas cellulose II films did not display a contact angle until the final stage of fibrillation. The films also showed increasing strength and an evolution of tensile strength from initially displaying a tear behavior indicating poor bonding to typical micro fibrillated cellulose films behavior as the fibers became increasingly fibrillated. The ultimate tensile strength for cellulose changed from tear behavior with no defined break to 134.5 MPa. While on the other hand, the same change for cellulose II was a maximum of 75.1 MPa from tear behavior. Increasing fibrillation of fibrils in both cases showed a decrease in fiber size, well differentiated for the two types of pulps at every stage.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Fabrication of titanium dioxide with durable superhydrophilicity by anodization","Abstract":"Titanium-based materials with specific wettability show promising potential applications. In this paper, a titanium plate with hydrophilicity was simply synthesized by anodization with an electrolyte composed of NaOH, and their durability of wettability in the air was evaluated. The properties of the anodized Ti plate were characterized by a series of tests including FESEM, roughness, BET surface area, XRD, XPS, water contact angle, UV-vis absorption, photoluminescence, photocatalytic decomposition ability of methylene blue, self-cleaning property and durability of wettability in the air. When the processing time of the anodization was 10 minutes, the resulting titanium plate had a water contact angle of 0 degrees, which proved that it was superhydrophilic, and it possessed a micro-nano composite architecture with a distinct nanofiber network chemically constituted of anatase and sodium titanate. It also exhibited excellent photocatalytic properties under UV illumination, including high photocatalytic activity and photocatalytic decomposition ability, as well as good self-cleaning properties, all of which rendered it to have good durability of wettability. Significantly, it can maintain the superhydrophilicity for 6 months in air. It is proposed that it is a synergy effect originating from the topology, chemical constitution and excellent photocatalytic properties that leads to the durable superhydrophilicity.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Enhancement of Nitrite Reduction Kinetics on Electrospun Pd-Carbon Nanomaterial Catalysts for Water Purification","Abstract":"We report a facile synthesis method for carbon nanofiber (CNF) supported Pd catalysts via one-pot electrospinning and their application for nitrite hydrogenation.

In this paper, SAp play a role as the shrinkage inhibiter to fabricate the SAp \"jammed\" polyimide gels. Herein, the \"jammed\" effect means that the polyimide backbones have been \"stretched up\" by the micron-scale SAp. Namely, the strong chains-packing effect, which is always taking placing during the gelation process and results in a high shrinkage of the polyimide backbones, has been effectively prevented by a simple physical mixture of SAp. This \"jammed\" effect greatly reduces the shrinkage as low as 7.5%. Meanwhile, SAp are treated as the pore formers to make a conversion to polyimide aerogel with ultra-low density of about 0.02 g cm (3). In addition, incorporation of SAp also dramatically enhances the hydrophobicity (water contact angle up to 152 circle). Overall, SAp \"jammed\" polyimide aerogels have low thermal conductivity (0.028-0.031 W m(-1) K-1), high mechanical strength, and high thermal stability. This combination of properties makes them more applicable as thermal insulators in harsh environments. Certainly, recycling of the scraped SAp by simple physical mixture with organic PI is also an advocated way for energy conservation.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Fully printed memristors for a self-sustainable recorder of mechanical energy","Abstract":"Memristors have attracted significant interest in recent years because of their role as a missing electronic component and unique functionality that has not previously existed. Since the first discoveries of the existence of memristive materials, various different fabrication processes for memristors have been presented. Here, a simple additive fabrication process is demonstrated where memristors were deposited on a polymer substrate by conventional inkjet printing. The memristor structure was printed on a 125 mu m thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate by sandwiching a thin layer of TiOx between two silver nanoparticle ink electrodes. Current-voltage (IV) characterization measurements were performed and they showed clear memristive behavior when voltage pulse amplitude varied between-1.5 V and 1.5 V. The corresponding resistance change is approximately between 150 Omega and 75 k Omega. In order to demonstrate the switching scheme in practical application, printed memristors and a printed voltage doubler were connected with a piezoelectric element. The element was subjected to impact-type excitation thus producing an electric charge that was able to switch the memristor between high and low resistive states. These results pave the way for an exploitation of cost-efficient, self-sufficient, all-printable memory elements for wide utilization in future electronics applications.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Increased Microbial Butanol Tolerance by Exogenous Membrane Insertion Molecules","Abstract":"Butanol is an ideal biofuel, although poor titers lead to high recovery costs by distillation. Fluidization of microbial membranes by butanol is one of the major factors limiting titers in butanol-producing bioprocesses. Starting with the hypothesis that certain membrane insertion molecules would stabilize the lipid bilayer in the presence of butanol, we applied a combination of invivo and invitro techniques within an insilico framework to describe a new approach to achieve solvent tolerance in bacteria. Single-molecule tracking of a model supported bilayer showed that COE1-5C, a five-ringed oligo-polyphenylenevinylene conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE), reduced the diffusion rate of phospholipids in a microbially derived lipid bilayer to a greater extent than three-ringed and four-ringed COEs. Furthermore, COE1-5C treatment increased the specific growth rate of E.coli K12 relative to a control at inhibitory butanol concentrations. Consequently, to confer butanol tolerance to microbes by exogenous means is complementary to genetic modification of strains in industrial bioprocesses, extends the physiological range of microbes to match favorable bioprocess conditions, and is amenable with complex and undefined microbial consortia for biobutanol production. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the -conjugated aromatic backbone of COE1-5C likely acts as a hydrophobic tether for glycerophospholipid acyl chains by enhancing bilayer integrity in the presence of high butanol concentrations, which thereby counters membrane fluidization. COE1-5C-mitigated E.coli K12 membrane depolarization by butanol is consistent with the hypothesis that improved growth rates in the presence of butanol are a consequence of improved bilayer stability.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"A dye-sensitized solar cell having polyaniline species in each component with 3.1%-efficiency","Abstract":"Pursuit of technological implementation with no sacrifice of photovoltaic performances has been a persistent objective for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).

Amaranthus waste is a natural, abundantly available, and yearly renewable source, acting as a single precursor for nitrogen (mainly from the lysine-rich amino acids) as well as carbon. It therefore eliminates the need for multiple hazardous chemicals including organic precursors for similar synthesis processes. Our facile experimental strategy without any activation supports reasonable nitrogen doping in porous carbon along with a high surface area and excellent conductivity, which leads to a superior electrocatalytic oxygen reduction activity and proves to be a promising alternative for costly Pt-based electrocatalysts in fuel cells in terms of excellent electrocatalytic performance, high selectivity, and long durability.

Many physiological processes, such as cell movement and division, involve bending and folding of the bilayer at high curvatures. Currently, bending of the bilayer is treated as an elastic deformation, such that its stress-strain response is independent of the rate at which bending strain is applied. We present here the first direct measurement of viscoelastic response in a lipid bilayer vesicle. We used a dual-beam optical trap (DBOT) to stretch 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Upon application of a step optical force, the vesicle membrane deforms in two regimes: a fast, instantaneous area increase, followed by a much slower stretching to an eventual plateau deformation. From measurements of dozens of GUVs, the average time constant of the slower stretching response was 0.225 +\/- 0.033 s (standard deviation, SD). Increasing the fluid viscosity did not affect the observed time constant. We performed a set of experiments to rule out heating by laser absorption as a cause of the transient behavior. Thus, we demonstrate here that the bending deformation of lipid bilayer membranes should be treated as viscoelastic.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Polypyrrole nanotubes versus nanofibers: A proposed mechanism for predicting the final morphology","Abstract":"This work addresses the preparation of polypyrrole (PPy) nanostructures using a template based on methyl orange (MO) and iron(III) chloride (FeCl3).

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, CHNS elemental analysis, and Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy were applied to prove the proposed hypothesis. The results indicated that utilization of relatively high amount of monomer possibly ensures the occurrence of template degradation process resulting in the formation of a hollow tubular structure; while the presence of low amount of pyrrole leads to a non-hollow fibrillar morphology. The relative molar ratio of MO:FeCl3 is supposed to be important for formation of template-based nanostructures. The effect of monomer addition method on the morphology of the final polypyrrole was also investigated, indicating that dropwise addition of pyrrole leads to the formation of PPy well-formed nanotubes, while the instantaneous addition manner results in formation of nanoparticles, as well.

The textural and chemical properties of the prepared activated carbon were characterized by N-2 adsorption\/desorption isotherms, SEM, Boehm's titration and XPS. Although AC-CHs had much lower surface area (less than 700 m(2) g(-1)) than AC-PA (1057 m(2) g(-1)), they exhibited 45-70% larger Ni(II) adsorption capacity which could be mainly attributed to their 50-75% higher contents of total acidic and basic groups. The comparison of XPS analyses for starch-based activated carbon before and after Ni(II) adsorption indicated that Ni(II) cation combined with the oxygen-containing groups and basic groups (delocalized pi-electrons) through the mechanisms of proton exchange, electrostatic attraction, and surface complexation. Kinetic results suggested that chemical reaction was the main rate-controlling step, and a very quick Ni(II) adsorption performance of AC-CHs was presented with similar to 95% of maximum adsorption within 30 min. Both adsorption capacity and rate of the activated carbon depended on the surface chemistry as revealed by batch adsorption experiments and XPS analyses. This study demonstrated that AC-CHs could be promising materials for Ni(II) pollution minimization.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Photoactivated Fuel Cells (PhotoFuelCells).

The contribution of functional groups such as amine, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, phosphate and lipids on PDOS to TCS biosorption was evaluated by means of chemical modification. The results showed that sulfhydryl groups gave the largest contribution, followed by lipids and amine groups, while the contribution of carboxyl groups could not be confirmed. FTIR spectra offered help to identify the introduced functional group changes. Based on the results, it was proposed that the TCS biosorption onto PDOS was determined by hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding rather than electrostatic interaction. The TCS biosorption process depended much on initial pH and the optimum pH value was 4.0. Kinetic studies demonstrated that a pseudo-second-order model was more applicable for description of the biosorption of TCS onto PDOS; both intra-particle diffusion and boundary layer diffusion might affect the biosorption rate. The Dubinnin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm agreed well with the biosorption equilibrium data over the whole concentration range, and the maximum biosorption capacity was 124.55 mg g(-1), revealing that biosorption via PDOS could be used as an effective method for TCS removal from aqueous solution.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Divergent enantioselective synthesis of hapalindole-type alkaloids using catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of a ketone to construct the chiral core structure","Abstract":"A divergent enantioselective approach to hapalindole-type alkaloids is described.

Two fluorinated hydrogels were also prepared by wet impregnation method. The samples were calcined in the temperature range of 550 to 850 degrees C. The surface properties of the samples were determined using DTA, XRD and nitrogen adsorption at -196 degrees C. The conversion of isopropanol was tested using microcatalytic pulse technique. DTA measurements showed that the addition of nickel oxide to zirconia influences the phase transition of ZrO2. XRD revealed that the tetragonal phase was formed at T <= 650 degrees C, while a biphasic mixture was obtained at T >= 750 degrees C. No spinel structure was detected by both DTA and XRD techniques and only traces of cubic NiO were detected for the samples containing >= 15 wt.% nickel oxide and calcined at T >= 750 degrees C. Significant changes in texture, surface acidity and catalytic activity were found as a result of the effects of thermal treatment and chemical composition. Incorporation of fluoride ions greatly increased the surface acidity and consequently enhanced the dehydration activity.

Developing a drug delivery system for effective cancer therapy with in vivo real-time noninvasive trackability is highly desired. Although fluorescence dyes are used for imaging hydrogels, the cytotoxicity limits their applications. By using sericin, a natural photoluminescent protein from silk, we successfully synthesized a hydrazone cross-linked sericin\/dextran injectable hydrogel. This hydrogel is biodegradable and biocompatibie. It achieves efficient drug loading and controlled release of both macromolecular and small molecular drugs.

As a response to the planarization of their polarized ground state, a red shift of their excitation maximum is expected to report on either the disorder, the tension, or the potential of biomembranes. The combination of chromophore planarization and polarization contributes to various, usually more complex processes in nature. Examples include the color change of crabs or lobsters during cooking or the chemistry of vision, particularly color vision. The summary of lessons from nature is followed by an overview of mechanosensitive organic materials. Although often twisted and sometimes also polarized, their change of color under pressure usually originates from changes in their crystal packing. Intriguing exceptions include the planarization of several elegantly twisted phenylethynyl oligomers and polymers. Also mechanosensitive probes in plastics usually respond to stretching by disassembly. True ground-state planarization in response to molecular recognition is best exemplified with the binding of thoughtfully twisted cationic polythiophenes to single- and double-stranded oligonucleotides. Molecular rotors, en vogue as viscosity sensors in cells, operate by deplanarization of the first excited state. Pertinent recent examples are described, focusing on -ratiometry and intracellular targeting. Complementary to planarization of the ground state with twisted push-pull probes, molecular rotors report on environmental changes with quenching or shifts in emission rather than absorption. The labeling of mechanosensitive channels is discussed as a bioengineering approach to bypass the challenge to create molecular mechanosensitivity and use biological systems instead to sense membrane tension. With planarizable push-pull probes, this challenge is met not with twistome screening, but with fluorescent flippers, a new concept to insert large and bright monomers into oligomeric probes to really feel the environment and also shine when twisted out of conjugation.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Downstream integration of microalgae harvesting and cell disruption by means of cationic surfactant-decorated Fe3O4 nanoparticles","Abstract":"Microalgal biofuel, albeit an exciting potential fossil-fuel-replacement candidate, still requires the development of more advanced downstream processing technology for its price competitiveness.

The post-harvesting cell-disruption step necessary to render microalgae suitable for lipid extraction, moreover, further raises energy consumption and cost. For the mitigation of biorefinery complexity and costs, we suggest herein a new scheme that integrates the critical downstream processes (harvesting and cell disruption) by means of cationic surfactant-decorated Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The cationic surfactants' quaternary ammonium heads play an important role in not only flocculating negatively charged microalgae but also weakening thick cell walls. In the present study, the harvesting efficiency and cell-damaging effects of three cationic surfactants - cetrimonium bromide (CTAB), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), and cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) - were evaluated. The CTAB-decorated Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which were found to be the most effective, achieved a 96.6% microalgae harvesting efficiency at a dosage of 0.46 g particle per g cell.

The 3R keys principles for the production of concrete materials that are relatively environmentally friendly are reduce, reuse, and recycle. This paper presents a laboratory study on the properties of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) incorporating fly ash and recycled alumina waste. Fly ash is used as a cement replacement at a fixed 20%, and recycled alumina waste is used as a fine aggregate replacement at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. The mixtures were designed to produce a controlled slump flow diameter. The properties examined in the study are workability and mechanical properties by using slump flow, J-ring flow, blocking flow assessment, V-funnel, compressive strength, and ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements. The results show that the use of fly ash and recycled alumina waste significantly improved the workability and increased the compressive strength of SCC mixtures. Further, all the mixtures showed an acceptable performance in regard to slump flow diameter and time tests. Mixes with high cement content and fly ash content into which recycled alumina waste content of up to 75% was incorporated had substantially lower V-funnel flow times and minimal blocking, flow times in the range of 4-6 s, V funnel times in the range of 8-12 s, and a difference in the slump flow and J-ring flow in the range of 2-3 cm. These mixes also exhibited minimal or no apparent blocking compared with conventional SCC. The results further indicate that economical SCC with 28-day compressive strength up to 56 MPa can be made using a high volume of recycled alumina waste, which is accompanied by a decrease of only one unit of strength.

Their therapeutic efficacy depends on rational control and regulation of the functions and behaviors of cells during their treatments. Different from conventional regulatory strategy by chemical adjuvants or genetic engineering, which is restricted by limited synergistic regulatory efficiency or uncertain safety problems, a novel approach based on nanoscale artificial materials can be applied to modify living cells to endow them with novel functions and unique properties. Inspired by natural \"nano shell\" and \"nano compass\" structures, cell nanomodification can be developed through both external and internal pathways. In this review, some novel cell surface engineering and intracellular nanoconjugation strategies are summarized. Their potential applications are also discussed, including cell protection, cell labeling, targeted delivery and in situ regulation. It is believed that these novel cell-material complexes can have great potentials for biomedical applications.

The main objective of this study was to investigate the sulfomethylation of haft lignin to produce water-soluble haft lignin with an anionic charge density. In this work, hardwood haft lignin was modified with formaldehyde and sodium sulfite under alkali conditions. The optimum conditions for sulfomethylation were 0.5 M NaOH(aq), 0.9 mol\/mol sodium hydroxymethyl sulfonate\/lignin at 100 degrees C for 3 h, and 20 g\/L lignin concentration. The resulting lignin had a charge density of -1.60 mequiv\/g and sulfonate group content of 1.48 mmol\/g. The molecular weight, structure, thermal behavior, and elemental analyses of the product were also assessed. The modified lignin was used as a cement dispersant, and the dispersibility of cement was increased from 60 to 155 mm by adding 1.2 wt % of sulfomethylated lignin to cement. Unmodified lignin did not change the dispersibility of cement.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Estimating Clothing Comfort Under Dynamic Conditions in the Evaluation of Some Biometric Parameters II. The evaluation of temperature and electrical resistance of the skin","Abstract":"Tests on wearing clothes are complex methods of analysis that mainly consist of recordings of physiological reactions in the body. During wearing tests physical parameters of the environment and biometric parameters were measured. Five garments, blouses, were tested under dynamic conditions; the products were worn by 5 subjects, female students. In the performed tests there were determined the following parameters: the skin temperature and the electrical resistance of the skin, under dynamic wearing conditions (repose, effort, recovery). The study demonstrated that the tests of wearing garments under certain conditions, through their complexity, provide a series of information and emphasize certain aspects that cannot be found in the laboratory tests results on textile materials. The performance of these types of tests and the accomplishment of the objectives imply the contribution of complex teams. Only through an interdisciplinary approach can the issues regarding wear comfort be solved.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Electrospun copper oxide nanofibers as infrared photodetectors","Abstract":"Copper oxide (CuO) nanofibers (NFs) were synthesized in the form of dense mesh via electrospinning technique and evaluated as infrared (IR) photodetectors.

Such efficient photodetection behavior of electrospun CuO NFs was attributed to their unique morphology defined by tiny crystalline domains attached together in a linear 1D fashion offering very high surface-to-volume ratio and efficient electron transport. It was also found that an appropriate thickness of CuO NFs mesh is required for optimizing device responsivity.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Relevance of fiber integrated gelatin-nanohydroxyapatite composite scaffold for bone tissue regeneration","Abstract":"Porous nanohydroxyapatite (nanoHA) is a promising bone substitute, but it is brittle, which limits its utility for load bearing applications. To address this issue, herein, biodegradable electrospun microfibrous sheets of poly(L-lactic acid)-(PLLA)-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were incorporated into a gelatin-nanoHA matrix which was investigated for its mechanical properties, the physical integration of the fibers with the matrix, cell infiltration, osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration. The inclusion of sacrificial fibers like PVA along with PLLA and leaching resulted in improved cellular infiltration towards the center of the scaffold. Furthermore, the treatment of PLLA fibers with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide enhanced their hydrophilicity, ensuring firm anchorage between the fibers and the gelatin-HA matrix. The incorporation of PLLA microfibers within the gelatin-nanoHA matrix reduced the brittleness of the scaffolds, the effect being proportional to the number of layers of fibrous sheets in the matrix. The proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells was augmented on the fibrous scaffolds in comparison to those scaffolds devoid of fibers. Finally, the scaffold could promote cell infiltration, together with bone regeneration, upon implantation in a rabbit femoral cortical defect within 4 weeks. The bone regeneration potential was significantly higher when compared to commercially available HA (Surgiwear T). Thus, this biomimetic, porous, 3D composite scaffold could be offered as a promising candidate for bone regeneration in orthopedics.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"A highly active and durable CuPdPt\/C electrocatalyst for an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction","Abstract":"Active, durable and cost-effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are of critical importance to the area of renewable energy.

Significantly, this hybrid catalyst exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity and durability. The CuPdPt\/C catalyst can achieve a factor of 701 enhancement in mass activity at -0.1 V vs. RHE compared with the commercial Pt\/C catalyst and it can endure at least 20 000 cycleswith negligible activity loss.

However, recovery and reuse of these nanostructures pose big threats from cost and environmental perspectives. Thus, various substrates have been employed for incorporating or immobilizing them but finding suitable substrate is still a big challenge. Paper, being a natural biopolymer, has been used recently to incorporate\/immobilize various metal oxide nanostructures. The metal oxide nanostructures are normally adhered to the cellulose matrices through weak interactions such as van der Waals force and hence, usually have retention related issues. This was circumvented to a great extent by using suitable linkers, binders, or retention aids for the incorporation\/immobilization of the nanostructures in paper matrices. Although these reagents improve retention, as well as some of the properties, they ultimately add cost to the final product. Additionally, these retention aids and linkers hinder accessibility of active surface sites of metal oxide nanostructures for their various applications. Very recently our group developed an in situ single step hydrothermal method to immobilize metal oxide nanostructures such as TiO2, ZnO, and Bi2O3 without using any binder, linker or retention aid. In this review a comprehensive account of the development of methodology for incorporation\/immobilization of metal oxide nanostructures is discussed. Furthermore, how the immobilization of nanostructures evolved without using any binder, linker or retention aid is thoroughly discussed based on the chemistry of the cellulose and metal oxides. Applications of nanostructure immobilized paper matrices are highlighted and critical challenges are discussed along with directions for future research.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Soy Phosphatidylinositol Containing Nanoparticle Prolongs Hemostatic Activity of B-Domain Deleted Factor VIII in Hemophilia A Mice","Abstract":"Factor VIII (FVIII) replacement therapy in hemophilia A (HA) is complicated by a short half-life and high incidence of inhibitory antibody response against the protein. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) containing lipidic nanoparticles have previously been shown to reduce the immunogenicity and prolong the half-life of full length FVIII. It has not been established whether this prolongation in half-life improves hemostatic efficacy and whether this approach could be extended to the B-domain deleted form of FVIII (BDD FVIII). In the current study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), hemostatic efficacy, and immunogenicity of BDD FVIII associated with PI nanoparticles (PI-BDD FVIII) in HA mice. Comparative human PK was predicted using an informed scaling approach. PI-BDD FVIII showed an approximate 1.5-fold increase in terminal half-life compared with free BDD FVIII following i.v. bolus doses of 40 IU\/kg. PI-BDD FVIII-treated animals retained hemostatic efficacy longer than the free FVIII-treated group in a tail vein transection model of hemostasis. PI association reduced the development of inhibitory and binding antibodies against BDD FVIII after a series of i.v. injections. The combined improvements in circulating half-life and hemostatic efficacy could significantly prolong the time above clinically established therapeutic thresholds of prophylactic FVIII replacement therapy in humans.

Nanocrystal CdSe QDs were attentively biosynthesized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae in vivo and were well reserved in the cytoplasm. The yeast membrane, with selective permeability, acted as a semipermeable filter to protect the intrafungal QDs from external interference, for example, from certain ions, peptides, proteins and insoluble solids. Moreover, the as-produced CdSe QDs were capped with cell-derived peptides and proteins, ruling out additional intracellular interference from the cytoplasm, including from some ions, lipids and nucleic acids. With the combination of the dual selective effects of both the yeast membrane and the capping proteins of the QDs, this methodology offered a rapid and reliable method for Cu2+ detection in water and plasma with detection limits as low as 1 mu mol L-1 and 2 mu mol L-1, respectively. In addition, the presence of the chelating reagent CN- could selectively chelate Cu2+ ions into Cu(CN)(n)((n-2)-a), resulting in the fluorescence recovery of the QDs, which further reinforced the specificity of Cu2+ detection. These results suggest that this technique via biogenic QD-containing microbes provided great potential for body fluid Cu2+ determination with superior selectivity, reliability and simplicity.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Separation of sulphuric acid from an acid suspension of cellulose nanocrystals by manual shaking","Abstract":"In this paper, the separation of sulphuric acid from a suspension of cellulose nanocrystal by manual shaking is described. Cellulose nanocrystals are prepared from acid hydrolysis of cotton using 64 wt% sulphuric acid at ca. 45 degrees C for 45 minutes. After the hydrolysis was complete, water was added to dilute the mixture to a resulting concentration of 30 wt% of the acid. This mixture was shaken rigorously in a closed container and after 48 hours, separation occurs such that cellulose nanocrystals float, with the bubbles introduced by the shaking, to give clear acid solution at the bottom. This shaking-floating process is repeatable for several cycles after the acid was removed from the bottom and more water was added. Using this simple process, the total acid recovery of > 90% has been achieved, and the concentration of all the acid recovered combined was 17.5 wt%. This work demonstrates a method that allows energy efficient and up-scalable separation of cellulose nanocrystals from the acidic suspension from which it was extracted.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"The Photocatalytic Efficacy of TiO2 Polymorphs, P-25 and Hexagonal ZnO in Sunlight Exposure for Water Decontamination: A Comparison","Abstract":"Although the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 polymorphs and hexagonal ZnO is well studied with artificial UV light sources, however, their efficacy is not well examined in natural sunlight exposure.

The polymorphs of TiO2 and hexagonal ZnO, after synthesis by sol-gel and hydrogel routes, were subjected to optical, structural and morphological characterization. The hexagonal ZnO exhibited significantly higher as compared to anatase and rutile polymorphs but comparable with that of P-25 in sunlight illumination. For the hexagonal ZnO, the ring opening route of degradation mediated by superoxide anion radicals was confirmed by the absence of non-hydroxylated aromatic intermediates whereas the contribution of both superoxide anion radicals and hydroxyl radicals was evidenced for the TiO2 polymorphs and P-25.

The addition of propylene oxide to the solution controls the gelation process, while the aging time and H2O\/ethanol molar ratio in the initial component determine the morphology of the gel. The bulk density of the as-prepared sample was 0.133 g\/cm(3), and the BET surface area was 505.6 m(2)\/g, which were very close to the values for the common alumina aerogel synthesized through the supercritical drying method. The microstructural evolution of the aerogel-like material as a function of aging time was carefully studied by SEM and TEM. The transition from solid particles to urchin-like mesoporous hollow microspheres can be explained as a self-templating process according to the Ostwald ripening mechanism. In addition, the samples were heat treated to 800 degrees C, 1000 degrees C and 1200 degrees C for 2 h. With an increase of the heat treatment temperature, the crystalline phases of the aerogel-like alumina varied from gamma-phase alumina to theta-phase alumina. The microstructures as well as the physical properties, such as the thermal conductivity and elastic modulus, of samples heat-treated at different temperatures were also measured and revealed that the samples exhibited excellent stability against high temperature.

The formation of pectin reduced GNPs (Pec-GNPs) was confirmed by using a UV-visible spectrophotometer, with a characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band at 527 nm. EDS analysis proved the presence of gold in the sample. The spherical morphology and crystalline nature of the Pec-GNPs was demonstrated by TEM analysis. The FTIR spectrum revealed the capping of pectin on the surface of the synthesised GNPs. Furthermore, the Pec-GNPs are found to be stable at different pH and electrolytic conditions. In vivo safety of the Pec-GNPs was established through zebra fish toxicity studies. The cationic drug doxorubicin was successfully loaded onto the synthesized anionic Pec-GNPs by an ionic complexation interaction. In vitro release studies confirmed the pH dependent sustained release of the doxorubicin. Doxorubicin loaded Pec-GNPs exhibited enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity on breast cancer cells compared to free doxorubicin, demonstrating that Pec-GNPs are efficient vehicles for the delivery of doxorubicin. Furthermore, chitosan coupled with folic acid (FA) was decorated with Pec-GNPs-DOX as a nanocarrier to improve the targeting and enhance the drug delivery to target cancer tissues by folic acid receptormediated endocytosis. It was concluded that the FA@Pec-GNPs-DOX were biocompatible and suitable for anti-cancer drug delivery, and were potentially promising as a new therapeutic system for cancer treatment.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Finite element modelling of the pyrolysis of wet wood subjected to fire","Abstract":"The modelling of the pyrolysis of wet wood provides more realistic fire scenarios for structural fire design by taking into account variable thermal properties of wood which are beyond the scope of conventional structural fire design codes.

The effect of lignin on the thermal and tribological properties of the lignin\/[CH][AA] lubricants was systematically investigated by means of thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and a friction and wear tester. The lignin in [CH][AA] has been demonstrated to be an effective additive to improve thermal stability, reduce the wear rates and stabilize the friction coefficients of lignin\/[CH][AA] lubricants. Density function theory calculations on the electronic structure of [CH][AA] ILs reveal the atomic natural charge of ILs and their hydrogen bonding capability with lignin. Moreover, these green lubricants show excellent anti-corrosive properties against commercial aluminum and iron boards. The strong physical adsorption of [CH][AA] ILs onto the steel surface and the reciprocal hydrogen bonding between [CH][AA] ILs and lignin synergistically contribute to the enhanced lubrication film strength and thus the tribological properties of these new lubricants. This work provides a new perspective on utilizing complete bio-products in advanced tribological lubrication systems.

However, the electrochemical performance of PEMFCs is still hindered by the high cost and insufficient durability of the traditional Pt-based cathode catalysts. Under these circumstances, the search for efficient alternatives to replace Pt for constructing highly efficient nonprecious metal catalysts (NPMCs) has been growing intensively and has received great interest. Combining with the compositional effects, the accurate design of NPMCs with 3D porous nanostructures plays a significant role in further enhancing ORR performance. These 3D porous architectures are able to provide higher specific surface areas and larger pore volumes, not only maximizing the availability of electron transfer within the nanosized electrocatalyst surface area but also providing better mass transport of reactants to the electrocatalyst.

Cell wall disassembly, especially of pectin polysaccharides, has been commonly related to fruit softening, but its influence has been poorly studied in grapes during postharvest life. In order to better understand this process, the Thompson seedless (TS) variety, which has significantly decreased berry texture after prolonged cold storage, was compared to NN107, a new table grape variety with higher berry firmness. Biochemical analysis revealed a greater amount of calcium in the cell wall of the NN107 variety and less reduction of uronic acids than TS during cold storage. In addition, the activity of polygalacturonase was higher in TS than NN107 berries; meanwhile pectin methylesterase activity was similar in both varieties. Polysaccharide analysis using carbohydrate gel electrophoresis (PACE) suggests a differential pectin metabolism during prolonged cold storage. Results revealed lower pectin fragments in TS after 60 days of cold storage and shelf life (SL) compared to 30 days of cold storage and 30 + SL, while NN107 maintained the same fragment profile across all time points evaluated. Our results suggest that these important differences in cell wall metabolism during cold storage could be related to the differential berry firmness observed between these contrasting table grape varieties.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Multifunctional Hydrogel Microparticles by Polymer-Assisted Photolithography","Abstract":"Although standard lithography has been the most common technique in micropatteming, ironically it has not been adopted to produce multifunctional hydrogel microparticles, which are highly useful for bioassays.

This study uses recycled materials (fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), and waste Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) glass powder) and Pd-Zr-Ti piezoelectric (PZT) to enhance intelligent functions of original substrates. The volumetric method is used for the design. The control group uses recycled materials to replace cement [0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%]. The PZT group uses a PZT powder to replace 5% of fine aggregates to make cement mortar to test the correlation between engineering and electricity properties of flow, compressive strength, water absorption, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and resistivity (electricity at 50 V and 100 V). The mechanical and electrical effects of cement mortar of various groups are discussed to determine the correlation between impedance characteristics and mechanical behavior of cement mortar in different electrical field environments and aqueous states, to build an engineering-electricity relation database for recycled materials and PZT, and to determine the relationships between various variables. A pozzolanic reaction occurs in GGBFS after 7 days. A 30% GGBFS replacement (32.9 MPa) has the maximum compressive strength. A 20% waste LCD glass powder replacement (31.8 MPa) can fill up finer pores and accelerate hydration. The addition of GGBFS and waste LCD glass powder reduces water absorption and internal porosity. Water absorption increases when fly ash is replaced. The resistivity at 50 V is higher than resistivity at 100 V in an electrical field environment. Specifically, in a high voltage environment, the resistivity generated during the delivery process is reduced. Because the voltage increase improves conductivity inside the specimen, the resistivity is reduced. The resistivity increases in correlation with compressive strength in the SSD state of fly ash and GGBFS. The resistivity decreases when the compressive strength increases in the OD state. The resistivity increases when the waste LCD glass powder is replaced in SSD and OD states. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, the influence of the macromolecular architecture on the swelling\/deswelling behavior for such hydrogels was investigated by tailor-made network structures. To this end, a series of chemically cross-linked polymeric hydrogels were synthesized via free radical-initiated copolymerization of sodium acrylate (SA) with the thermoresponsive comonomer N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) by realizing different structural types. In particular, two different polyNIPAAm macromonomers, either with one acrylate function at the chain end or with additional acrylate functions as side groups were synthesized by controlled polymerization and subsequent polymer-analogous reaction and then used as building blocks. The rheological behaviors of hydrogels and their estimated mesh sizes are discussed. The performance of the hydrogels in terms of swelling and deswelling in both deionized water (DI) and brackish water (2 g\/L NaCl) was measured as a function of cross-linking degree and particle size. The salt content could be reduced by 23% in one cycle by using the best performing material.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"In vitro studies of polyethyleneimine coated miRNA microspheres as anticancer agents","Abstract":"RNA plays important roles as a gene-silencing agent, a therapeutic agent for clinical treatment, and in the differentiation, proliferation, and development of cells. However, RNA is very difficult to work with due to its sensitivity and fragility. Another obstacle in using RNA for gene delivery\/silencing is its negative charge, which causes its repulsion by cell membranes, which are also negatively charged. Our recent study showed that miR-125b is upregulated in glioblastoma (GMB) and plays an oncogenic role in GMB cells by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Endogenous miR-125b can be blocked by transfection of its antisense RNA molecule, miR-125b antisense (miR-125b-AS). Thus, miR- 125b-AS can be developed as an RNA-based agent for cancer treatment. However, instability during storage and difficulty in delivery into cells has limited the use of RNA-based therapies thus far. In the current work, we demonstrate a short and simple one-step technique for the preparation of positively charged RNA nanospheres (miR-125b-RNS and miR-125b-AS-RNS) coated with a bioavailable polymer, polyethylenimine (PEI). These RNA nanospheres are able to penetrate the cell directly without the use of liposomes. Our study confirmed that converting miR-125b and miR-125b-AS into nanospheres is a viable approach for storing RNA. In addition, this study provides evidence that PEI-coated RNA nanospheres have the potential to be used as a novel class of anticancer agents.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Facile fabrication of shape memory poly(epsilon-caprolactone) non-woven mat by combining electrospinning and sol-gel reaction","Abstract":"Poly(3-caprolactone)-based non-woven fibrous mats showing excellent one-way shape memory properties were obtained through a straightforward approach by combining electrospinning process and sol-gel reaction.

The novel Ag-PWE with excellent conductivity was constructed through the growth of an Ag nanosphere layer on the surfaces of cellulose fibers and served to provide a good pathway for electron transfer and enhance the amount of captured antibody (Ab1). Au nanocages, which possessed a hollow structure, were first used to construct the ECL immunosensor as a signal amplification carrier. Both the inner and outer surfaces of the Au nanocages can adsorb Ru(bpy)(3)(2+), therefore the signal can be amplified as much as possible. In addition, this as-prepared 3D microfluidic origami ECL immunodevice had the advantages of high sensitivity, acceptable precision and reasonable accuracy. On the basis of the considerably amplified ECL signal and sandwich-type format, the as-proposed immunodevice successfully fulfilled the highly sensitive detection of CEA with a linear range of 0.001-50 ng mL(-1) and a detection limit of 0.0007 ng mL(-1).

The structures under consideration are rather diverse and cover a wide spectrum. This Account will summarize current works on the synthetic concepts leading toward those systems and cover the application side where emphasis is set on the exploration of those systems as candidates for unusual high-performance catalysis, electrocatalysis, electrochemical energy storage, and artificial photosynthesis. These issues are motivated by the new global energy cycles and the fact that sustainable technologies should not be based on rare and expensive resources. We therefore present the strategic design of functionality in cost-effective, affordable artificial materials starting from a spectrum of simple synthetic options to end up with carbon- and nitrogen-based porous frameworks. Following the synthetic strategies, we demonstrate how the electronic structure of polymeric frameworks can be tuned and how this can modify property profiles in a very unexpected fashion. Covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs), for instance, showed both enormously high energy and high power density in lithium and sodium battery systems. Other C,N-based organic frameworks, such as triazine-based graphitic carbon nitride, are suggested to show promising band gaps for many (photo)electrochemical reactions. Nitrogen-rich carbonaceous frameworks, which are developed from C,N-based organic framework strategies, are highlighted in order to address their promising electrocatalytic properties, such as in the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). With careful design, those materials can be multifunctional catalysts, such as a bifunctional ORR\/OER electrocatalyst. Although the majority of new C,N-based materials are still not competitive with the best (usually nonsustainable candidates) for each application, the framework\/N approach as such is still in its infancy and has already moved organic materials to regions where otherwise only traditional noble metals or special inorganic semiconductors are found. As one potential way to enhance the properties of polymeric frameworks, the idea of catalysts having unique active surfaces based on Mott-Schottky heterojunctions and related concepts are addressed. In order to integrate all of the above versatile subjects from synthesis to applications on C,N-based organic frameworks, we begin the discussion with synthetic concepts and strategies for these frameworks to distinguish these systems from typical covalent organic frameworks based on boron oxide rings. Next we focus on the semiconducting properties of C,N-based organic frameworks in order to show a continuous transition between CTFs and other systems, such as graphitic carbon nitrides. At the end, applications of these materials are shown by highlighting their properties in electrochemical energy storage and photo- and electro catalysis.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Chiral carbon dots derived from guanosine 5 '-monophosphate form supramolecular hydrogels","Abstract":"Guanosine 5'-monophosphate, (5'-GMP), is a self-assembling natural nucleotide that has unique potential to form ordered supramolecular structures.

The new screen-printing approach offers large-scale cost-effective fabrication of efficient multi-functional chemically-powered motors. Diverse fish architectures, consisting of several predesigned printed layers, including the mid-body, head, tail, and an entire fish, are achieved by printing different functional inks through the corresponding patterned stencils. The 2D fish-printing approach allows fine control of the shape, size, functionality and performance of the resulting fish swimmers. In particular, different functionalities can be incorporated at specific areas by sequential printing of specific layers based on different modified inks. For example, printing of catalytic tails containing various Pt loadings has been used to prepare fish with different propulsion efficiencies. Inks based on activated carbon powder have been used for accelerated removal of chemical pollutants. Nickel-containing carbon ink has been used for magnetic control of the fish directionality.

Mechanistic studies in the late 1990s probed glycosyl iodide formation by NMR spectroscopy and revealed important reactivity features embedded in protecting-group stereoelectronics. Differentially protected sugars having an anomeric acetate were reacted with trimethylsilyl iodide (TMSI) to generate the glycosyl iodides. In the absence of C-2 participation, generation of the glycosyl iodide proceeded by inversion of the starting anomeric acetate stereochemistry. Once formed, the glycosyl iodide readily underwent in situ anomerization, and in the presence of excess iodide, equilibrium concentrations of alpha- and beta-iodides were established. Reactivity profiles depended upon the identity of the sugar and the protecting groups adorning it. Consistent with the modern idea of disarmed versus armed sugars, ester protecting groups diminished the reactivity of glycosyl iodides and ether protecting groups enhanced the reactivity. Thus, acetylated sugars were slower to form the iodide and anomerize than their benzylated analogues, and these disarmed glycosyl iodides could be isolated and purified, whereas armed ether-protected iodides could only be generated and reacted in situ. All other things being equal, the beta-iodide was orders of magnitude more reactive than the thermodynamically more stable alpha-iodide, consistent with the idea of in situ anomerization introduced by Lemieux in the mid-20th century. Glycosyl iodides are far more reactive than the corresponding bromides, and with the increased reactivity comes increased stereocontrol, particularly when forming a-linked linear and branched oligosaccharides. Reactions with per-O-silylated glycosyl iodides are especially useful for the synthesis of a-linked glycoconjugates. Silyl ether protecting groups make the glycosyl iodide so reactive that even highly functionalized aglycon acceptors add. Following the coupling event, the TMS ethers are readily removed by methanolysis, and since all of the byproducts are volatile, multiple reactions can be performed in a single reaction vessel without isolation of intermediates. In this fashion, per-O-TMS monosaccharides can be converted to biologically relevant alpha-linked glycolipids in one pot. The stereochemical outcome of these reactions can also be switched to beta-glycoside formation by addition of silver to chelate the iodide, thus favoring S(N)2 displacement of the alpha-iodide. While iodides derived from benzyl and silyl ether-protected oligosaccharides are susceptible to interglycosidic bond cleavage when treated with TMSI, the introduction of a single acetate protecting group prevents this unwanted side reaction. Partial acetylation of armed glycosyl iodides also attenuates HI elimination side reactions. Conversely, fully acetylated glycosyl iodides are deactivated and require metal catalysis in order for glycosidation to occur. Recent findings indicate that I-2 activation of per-O-acetylated mono-, di-, and trisaccharides promotes glycosidation of cyclic ethers to give beta-linked iodoalkyl glycoconjugates in one step. Products of these reactions have been converted into multivalent carbohydrate displays. With these synthetic pathways elucidated, chemical reactivity can be exquisitely controlled by the judicious selection of protecting groups to achieve high stereocontrol in step-economical processes.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Volatile Profile of Cashew Apple Juice Fibers from Different Production Steps","Abstract":"This study aimed to determine the volatile profile of cashew apple fibers to verify which compounds are still present after successive washings and thus might be responsible for the undesirable remaining cashew-like aroma present in this co-product, which is used to formulate food products like vegetarian burgers and cereal bars.

Compounds were analyzed by the headspace solid-phase micro extraction technique (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), using a DB-5 column. Sensory analysis was also performed to compare the intensity of the cashew-like aroma of the fibers with the original juice. Altogether, 80 compounds were detected, being esters and terpenes the major chemical classes. Among the identified substances, 14 were classified as odoriferous in the literature, constituting the matrix used in the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Odoriferous esters were substantially reduced, but many compounds were extracted by the strength used in the expeller press and remained until the last wash. Among them are the odoriferous compounds ethyl octanoate, -dodecalactone, (E)-2-decenal, copaene, and caryophyllene that may contribute for the mild but still perceptible cashew apple aroma in the fibers that have been pressed and washed five times. Development of a deodorization process should include reduction of pressing force and stop at the second wash, to save water and energy, thus reducing operational costs and contributing to process sustainability.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Controllable Heparin-Based Comb Copolymers and Their Self-assembled Nanoparticles for Gene Delivery","Abstract":"Polysaccharide-based copolymers have attracted much attention due to their effective performances.

The structural morphology, electromagnetic interference shielding (EMI) performance and mechanical properties as well as the thermal stability of GA-EP composites were comprehensively and comparatively investigated.

Both SGA-EP and LGA-EP exhibit excellent electrical conductivity, while the interconnected network with large graphene sheets in LGA-EP provides more effective and fast channels for electron transport than that of SGA-EP.

In the current work, the removal of two representative OPs, glyphosate (GP) and glufosinate (GF), was investigated by the exceptionally stable Zr-based MOFs of UiO-67. The abundant Zr-OH groups, resulting from the missing-linker induced terminal hydroxyl groups and the inherent bridging ones in Zr-O clusters of UiO-67 particles, served as natural anchorages for efficient GP and GF capture in relation with their high affinity toward phosphoric groups in OPs. The correlation between the most significant parameters such as contact time, OPs concentration, adsorbent dose, pH, as well as ionic strength with the adsorption capacities was optimized, and the effects of these parameters on the removal efficiency of GP and GF from the polluted aqueous solution were investigated. The adsorption of GP on UiO-67 was faster than that of GF, and a pseudo-second-order rate equation effectively described the uptake kinetics. The Langmuir model exhibited a better fit to adsorption isotherm than the Freundlich model. Thanks to the strong affinity and adequate pore size, the adsorption capacities in UiO-67 approached as high as 3.18 mmol (537 mg) g(-1) for GP and 1.98 mmol (360 mg) g(-1) for GF, which were much higher than those of many other reported adsorbents. The excellent adsorption characteristics of the current adsorbents toward OPs were preserved in a wide pH window and high concentration of the background electrolytes. These prefigured the promising potentials of UiO-67 as novel adsorbent for the efficient removal of OPs from aqueous solution.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Smart Hydrogel-Based Valves Inspired by the Stomata in Plants","Abstract":"We report the design of hydrogels that can act as \"smart\" valves or membranes. Each hydrogel is engineered with a pore (about 1 cm long and <1 mm thick) that remains closed under ambient conditions but opens under specific conditions. Our design is inspired by the stomatal valves in plant leaves, which regulate the movement of water and gases in and out of the leaves. The design features two different gels, active and passive, which are attached concentrically to form a disc-shaped hybrid film. The pore is created in the central active gel, and the conditions for opening the pore can be tuned based on the chemistry of this gel. For example, if the active gel is made from N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA), the actuation of the pore depends on the temperature of water relative to 32 degrees C, which is the lower-critical solution temperature (LCST) of NIPA. The concentric design of our hybrid provides directionality to the volumetric transition of the active gel, i.e., it ensures that the pore opens as the active gel shrinks. In turn, contact with hot water (T > 32 degrees C) opens the pore and allows the water to pass through the gel. Conversely, the pore remains closed when the water is cold (T < 32 degrees C). The gel thereby acts as a \"smart\" valve that is able to regulate the flow of solvent depending on its properties. We have extended the concept to other stimuli that can cause gel-swelling transitions including solvent composition, pH, and light. Additionally, when two different gel based valves are arranged in series, the assembly acts as a logical \"AND\" gate, i.e., water flows through the valve-combination only if it simultaneously satisfies two distinct conditions (such as its pH being below a critical value and its temperature being above a critical value).","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Carbon nanofiber-supported B2O3-SnOx glasses as anode materials for high-performance lithium-ion batteries","Abstract":"A series of carbon nanofiber-supported B2O3-SnOx glasses (0B(2)O(3)-SnOx\/CNFs, 0.5B(2)O(3)-SnOx\/CNFs, 1.5B(2)O(3)-SnOx\/CNFs and 3B(2)O(3)-SnOx\/CNFs) have been prepared by an electrospinning technique, and a subsequent stabilization and carbonization treatment.

The most important strategy in slowing this process is via the intervention of radical-trapping antioxidants (RTAs), which are abundant in nature and included as additives to almost every petroleum-derived product as well as several other commercial products. Accordingly, a longstanding objective of many academic and industrial scientists has been the design and development of novel RTAs that can outperform natural and industrial standards, such as a-tocopherol, the most biologically active form of vitamin E, and dialkylated diphenylamines, respectively. Some time ago we recognized that attempts to maximize the reactivity of phenolic RTAs had largely failed because substitution of the phenolic ring with electron-donating groups to weaken the O-H bond and accelerate the rate of H atom transfer to radicals leads to compounds that are unstable in air. We surmised that incorporating nitrogen into the phenolic ring would render them more stable to one-electron oxidation, enabling their substitution with strong electron-donating groups. Guided by computational chemistry, we demonstrated that replacing the phenyl ring in very electron-rich phenols with either 3-pyridyl or 5-pyrimidyl rings leads to phenolic-like RTAs with good air stability and great reactivity. In fact, rate constants determined for the reactions of some compounds with peroxyl radicals were almost 2 orders of magnitude greater than those for a-tocopherol and implied that the reactions proceeded without an enthalpic barrier. Following extensive thermochemical and kinetic characterization, we took our studies of these compounds to more physiologically relevant media, such as lipid bilayers and human low density lipoproteins, where the heterocyclic analogues of vitamin E shone, displaying unparalleled abilities to inhibit lipid peroxidation and prompting their current investigation in animal models of degenerative disease. Moreover, we carried out studies of these compounds in several industrially relevant contexts and in particular demonstrated that they could be used synergistically with less reactive, less expensive, phenolic RTAs. More recently, our attention has turned to the application of these ideas to maximizing the reactivity of diarylamine RTAs that are common in additives to petroleum-derived products, such as lubricating oils, transmission and hydraulic fluids, and rubber. In doing so, we have developed the most reactive diarylamines ever reported. The 3-pyridyl- and 5-pyrimidyl-containing diarylamines are easily accessed using Pd- and\/or Cu-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, and display an ideal compromise between reactivity and stability. The most reactive compounds are characterized by rate constants for reactions with peroxyl radicals that are independent of temperature, implying that-as for the most reactive heterocyclic phenols-these reactions proceed without an enthalpic barrier. Unprecedented reactivity was also observed when hydrocarbon autoxidations were carried out at elevated temperatures, real-world conditions where diarylamines are uniquely effective because of a catalytic RTA activity that makes use of the hydrocarbon substrate as a sacrificial reductant. Our studies to date suggest that heterocyclic diarylamines have real potential to increase the longevity of petroleum-derived products in a variety of applications where diphenylamines are currently used.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Non-Covalent Interactions in Hydrogen Storage Materials LiN(CH3)(2)BH3 and KN(CH3)(2)BH3","Abstract":"In the present work, an in-depth, qualitative and quantitative description of non-covalent interactions in the hydrogen storage materials LiN(CH3)(2)BH3 and KN(CH3)(2)BH3 was performed by means of the charge and energy decomposition method (ETS-NOCV) as well as the Interacting Quantum Atoms (IQA) approach. It was determined that both crystals are stabilized by electrostatically dominated intra- and intermolecular M...H-B interactions (M = Li, K). For LiN(CH3)(2)BH3 the intramolecular charge transfer appeared (B-HLi) to be more pronounced compared with the corresponding intermolecular contribution. We clarified for the first time, based on the ETS-NOCV and IQA methods, that homopolar BH...HB interactions in LiN(CH3)(2)BH3 can be considered as destabilizing (due to the dominance of repulsion caused by negatively charged borane units), despite the fact that some charge delocalization within BH...HB contacts is enforced (which explains H...H bond critical points found from the QTAIM method). Interestingly, quite similar (to BH...HB) intermolecular homopolar dihydrogen bonds CH...HC appared to significantly stabilize both crystalsthe ETS-NOCV scheme allowed us to conclude that CH...HC interactions are dispersion dominated, however, the electrostatic and sigma\/sigma*(C-H) charge transfer contributions are also important.

Liposomes are bound to a polymer-modified QCM surface, and heat is induced in the bilayer via light absorption into gold nanopartides (GNPs) embedded in the liposomes. Because of very rapid heat transfer at the nanoscale, nanopartides can reside either in the liposome cavity or within the bilayer to cause changes in the lipid viscoelasticity. The changes are observed as changes in the film relaxation time as well as by mapping the measured resonance frequency versus resistance. The QCM results indicate that viscoelastic changes occur throughout the vesicle layer, possibly causing fusion between the liposomes.

We propose a simple model for the diffusion of charged nanoparticles in cross-linked, charged hydrogels based on a cubic periodic environment and an electrostatic interaction potential of varying range and strength, encompassing attractive and repulsive scenarios. The long-time diffusive properties are investigated by use of Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical methods. A number of experimentally observed phenomena attributed to nonsteric interactions between hydrogel polymers and diffusing particle are naturally reproduced by our model. Charged particles diffuse slower than uncharged particles, regardless of the sign of the surface charge, but with a stronger hindrance effect for attractive electrostatic interactions. This is explained in terms of charged particles sticking to the polymer network in regions of strong opposite charge and their exclusion from similarly charged regions. In the case of attractive interactions between hydrogel polymers and the diffusing particle, smaller charged particles diffuse slower than larger ones. This stands in contrast to a size filtering scenario but is in agreement with experimental findings. In the case of repulsive interactions, a range of differently sized particles diffuse equally fast. We compare our model predictions with published experiments on charged particle diffusion in hydrogels and confirm that electrostatic interactions are a key factor influencing the diffusivity of charged nanoparticles and that oppositely charged gels are much more effective in slowing down a charged particle than similarly charged gels.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Mesoporous chitosan\/silica hybrid material applied for development of electrochemical sensor for paracetamol in presence of dopamine","Abstract":"A mesoporous and thermally stable chitosan\/silica bioinorganic hybrid material prepared with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0% w\/w chitosan\/silica was obtained by sol gel method.

A loosely packed molecular organization is obtained as a consequence of the noncentrosymmetric chemical structure of molecule A1, which gives rise to considerable free volume and weak intermolecular interactions. The stacking features of the CT complex result in an external stimuli-responsive molecular stacking reorganization between the mixed and demixed phases of the D-A pair. Accordingly, high-contrast fluorescence switching (red <-> blue) is realized on the basis of the strong alternation of the electronic properties between the mixed and demixed phases. A combination of structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies reveal the underlying mechanism of this stimuli-responsive behavior.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Graphene functionalized attapulgite\/sulfur composite as cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries for energy storage","Abstract":"Graphene nanosheets (GNs) functionalized attapulgite (ATTP)\/sulfur (ATTP@GNs\/S) composites were prepared through the melt-diffusion method, and investigated as cathode of lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries.

FTIR spectra of the as-spun fibers indicate the presence of both, PVP and M ions, interacting through amide-M coordination bonds. Thermogravimetric analyses of the as-spun fibers show that 400 degrees C is the temperature at which samples lose the maximum amount of weight. After thermal treatments at 300, 600, 800, and 900 degrees C for 2 hours black powders were obtained. Their XRD patterns show the presence of a pure crystalline spinel-type phase. Fiber morphology was corroborated, for as-electrospun and fired samples at 600 degrees C (for 2 h), by SEM. Vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurements show the characteristic ferrimagnetic behavior and, saturation magnetization and coer-civity, values tailored by substitution of cobalt ions.

Under optimal GVL\/water ratio, Eucalyptus globulus wood was effectively fractionated in a single step into its principal components. The pulp fraction, characterized by high yield, high cellulose purity and high bleachability, was directly spun to produce regenerated cellulosic fibers with mechanical properties comparable to the best man-made fibers currently available in the market. Most of the hemicelluloses and lignin in wood were extracted and dissolved into the spent liquor. The dissolved hemicellulose-based fraction may be upgraded to furanic platform chemicals in subsequent catalytic conversion processes. About 50-60% of the extracted lignin was precipitated by the addition of water, an anti-solvent. The precipitated lignin was characterized by low carbohydrate and ash contamination, high phenolic content, relatively low polydispersity and low molecular mass. The lignin extracted by GVL\/water fractionation may thus be suitable for a wide range of energy, material or chemical applications.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Properties and applications of halloysite nanotubes: recent research advances and future prospects","Abstract":"Halloysite is a natural nanosized tubular clay mineral that has many potentially important uses in different industrial fields.

Herein, a green but powerful two-step method based on solvothermal treatment was proposed to synthesize semi-transparent two-dimensional (2D) leaf-like CZTS plate arrays (PLAr) in situ on a FTO glass substrate, without any post-treatments, such as annealing, toxic sulfurization, or coating with other ancillary materials. The growth mechanism of the 2D leaf-like CZTS PLAr based on solvothermal treatment was illustrated. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.09% was obtained by utilizing leaf-like CZTS PLAr as the CE. Surprisingly, the PCE increased to 8.67% assisted by a mirror reflection. The excellent performance of DSSCs could be attributed to the high catalytic surface area, fast photo-generated electron transport at the counter electrode\/redox electrolyte interface, remarkable electrocatalytic activity for I-3(-) reduction, low charge transfer resistance toward the reduction of I-3(-) ions, and high diffusion coefficient of the I-3(-). This work provides a green and feasible approach to construct high-quality metal sulfide nanoarrays on arbitrary conductive substrates under mild conditions (i.e. low temperature, no annealing, green, speediness) and promotes the development of Pt-free sulfide materials for sustainable photovoltaic applications.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Potential of Melaleuca diosmifolia as a novel, non-conventional and low-cost coagulating adsorbent for removing both cationic and anionic dyes","Abstract":"The potential of dried twigs of Melaleuca diosmifolia as a novel biosorbent for removing three cationic dyes, methylene blue (MB), acridine orange (AO) and malachite green (MG), and an anionic dye, eriochrome black T (EB) was evaluated in a batch adsorption process. Notably, the biosorbent removed 77-99% of both cationic and anionic dyes in a wide ranging pH of 2-10, and the reactions were endothermic. The dye adsorption equilibria were rapidly attained within 3 h. The monolayer adsorption capacity of the sorbent added at 5 g L-1 was 119.05, 126.8, 116.28 and 94.34 mg g(-1) for MB, AO, MG and EB, respectively. The water extract obtained from the plant material induced fast decolourization of both categories of dyes followed by gradual flocculation, indicating its potential as a natural coagulant. Gas chromatographic analysis also indicated that the main electrostatic attraction between 1,8-cineole, 1-p-methene-8-thiol and furfural compounds of the biomaterial, and dye molecules resulted in the formation of initial supramolecular complexes which further progressed into strong aggregates, leading to precipitation of dye-biomaterial complexes. Subsequently, the overall complex mechanism of dye removal was confirmed to be a combined process of adsorption and coagulation. Consistent with the batch studies, using selected plant material in real environmental water samples also resulted in effective dye removal, highlighting its potential for use in wastewater treatment.

In the present work, a visible ultrashort laser pulse was used to cause an induced Raman process, whereby Raman active molecular vibrational modes were excited in the electronic ground states, which triggers the reaction induced by coherent molecular vibrational excitation in the electronic ground state just after photo excitation.

Herein, we report, for the first time, the bioinspired synthesis of a collagen\/hydroxyapatite (HA) porous scaffold (CHPS) according to the following stages: (i) fabrication of collagen fibre porous scaffold (CFPS) by a needle-punching process; (ii) deposition of brushite\/chitosan (DCPD\/CS) on CHPS by a dip-coating method; and (iii) formation of CHPS by in situ conversion of DCPD to HA. The CHPS exhibits three-dimensional (3D) interconnected porous structures with pore sizes of around 60 mm. HA crystals distribute homogeneously on the CHPS, and display wheat-like shapes with a length of approximately 200 nm and a width of approximately 80 nm. The in vitro cell tests by using human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) indicate that the HA crystals in the CHPS not only promote the cell adhesion and proliferation of the hBMSCs, but also stimulate osteogenic differentiation. The in vivo results reveal that the CHPS exhibits better osteoinductivity than the CFPS because of its similar chemical components, crystallinity and crystallographic texture to natural bone. Moreover, the CHPS can stimulate new bone formation in rat critical-sized calvarial defects within 8 weeks. The CHPS possesses a favourable pore structure, and excellent biocompatibility and osteoinductivity, and thus it has great potential applications for bone tissue engineering.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Metal-organic nanofibers as anodes for lithium-ion batteries","Abstract":"Metal organic nanofibers (MONFs) synthesized from precursors of amino acid and copper nitrate were applied as anode materials for Li-ion batteries.

Using a statistical mechanical treatment, we study circuit topology landscapes of linear polymer chains with intra-chain contacts as a prototype of linearly sorted objects with interactions. We find generic features of the topological space and study the statistical properties of the space under the most basic constraints on the occupancy of arrangements and topological interactions. We observe that a set of correlated contact sites (a sector) could nontrivially influence the entropy of circuits as the number of involved sites increases. Finally, we discuss how constraints can be inferred from the information provided by local contact distributions in the presence of a sector.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Effect of algal species and light intensity on the performance of an air-lift-type microbial carbon capture cell with an algae-assisted cathode","Abstract":"The performances were investigated for air-lift-type microbial carbon capture cells (ALMCCs) with Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella sp. as cathodic microorganisms. The two ALMCC systems showed differences in CO2 fixation, lipid production and power generation.

By conducting further experiments with Chlorella vulgaris under different light intensities (2.4, 5.0, 8.9 and 11.4 W m(-2)), the ALMCC was found to be sensitive to light intensities. The maximum power outputs and CO2 fixation rate were observed under light intensity of 8.9 W m(-2) (972.5 mW m-3 and 887.8 mg L-1 d(-1), respectively).

The obtained aerogels can be used as efficient catalysts for organic dye degradation, reduction of 4-nitrophenol, and synthesis of bis(indolyl)methane. A set of characterizations, including FESEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, Raman, FTIR, optical absorption, and photoluminescence techniques, confirm that the aerogel is formed from ultra-dispersed AgI nanocrystals and the self-assembly of reduced graphene oxide nanosheets into porous hydrogel structures. The obtained aerogels exhibit high photocatalytic degradation ability toward an organic dye (rhodamine-B) because of the high visible light-driven catalytic activity of AgI and the high specific surface area of graphene nanosheets with three-dimensional interconnected pores. The well-wrapped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets on AgI nanostructures could promote the transfer of photo-generated electrons, which not only effectively inhibits the recombination of electrons and holes but also suppresses the photocorrosion of AgI; this promotes the photocatalytic activity and stability. Moreover, these nanostructures show the best catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol in the presence of NaBH4 as a reducing agent.

Despite exhibiting a high-energy content, lignin is typically slated for combustion in modern biorefineries due to its inherent heterogeneity and recalcitrance, whereas cellulose and hemicellulose are converted to renewable fuels and chemicals. However, it is critical for the viability of third-generation biorefineries to valorize lignin alongside polysaccharides. To that end, we employ metabolic engineering, separations, and catalysis to convert lignin-derived species into cis, cis-muconic acid, for subsequent hydrogenation to adipic acid, the latter being the most widely produced dicarboxylic acid. First, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 was metabolically engineered to funnel lignin-derived aromatics to cis, cis-muconate, which is an atom-efficient biochemical transformation. This engineered strain was employed in fed-batch biological cultivation to demonstrate a cis, cis-muconate titer of 13.5 g L-1 in 78.5 h from a model lignin-derived compound. cis, cis-Muconic acid was recovered in high purity (>97%) and yield (74%) by activated carbon treatment and crystallization (5 degrees C, pH 2).

AC3 deficiency leads to defects in olfaction. However, it is still unknown whether AC3 deficiency affects gene expression or olfactory signal transduction pathways within the main olfactory epithelium (MOE). In this study, gene microarrays were used to screen differentially expressed genes in MOE from AC3 knockout (AC3(-\/-)) and wild-type (AC3(+\/+)) mice. The differentially expressed genes identified were subjected to bioinformatic analysis and verified by qRT-PCR. Gene expression in the MOE from AC3(-\/-) mice was significantly altered, compared to AC3(+\/+) mice. Of the 41266 gene probes, 3379 had greater than 2-fold fold change in expression levels between AC3(-\/-) and AC3(+\/+) mice, accounting for 8% of the total gene probes. Of these genes, 1391 were up regulated, and 1988 were down regulated, including 425 olfactory receptor genes, 99 genes that are specifically expressed in the immature olfactory neurons, 305 genes that are specifically expressed in the mature olfactory neurons, and 155 genes that are involved in epigenetic regulation. Quantitative RT-PCR verification of the differentially expressed epigenetic regulation related genes, olfactory receptors, ion transporter related genes, neuron development and differentiation related genes, lipid metabolism and membrane protein transport etc. related genes showed that P75NTR, Hinfp, Gadd45b, and Tet3 were significantly up-regulated, while Olfr370, Olfr1414, Olfr1208, Golf, Faim2, Tsg101, Mapk10, Actl6b, H2BE, ATF5, Kirrrel2, OMP, Drd2etc. were significantly down-regulated.

Reliable durability assessment of concrete structures in relation to their environment thus requires accurate unsaturated water transport description as well as reliable input data. The effect of carbonation on water transport remains poorly studied and data are lacking. It was then the purpose of this article to acquire all the data needed to describe unsaturated water transport in carbonated cementitious materials (porosity, water retention and unsaturated permeability). Four hardened pastes made with four different binders were carbonated at 3% CO2 to ensure representativeness with natural carbonation. Beyond the modification of the water retention curve and porosity clogging, significant microcracking due to carbonation shrinkage was observed. The consequence on permeability highlighted a competition between porosity clogging and microcracking that was dependent on the initial mineralogical composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The thermo-mechanical properties of the resulting polymers were characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), and tensile tests. The effect of the ratio of AESO and MV on the thermo-mechanical properties of the copolymers was investigated. Increasing MV content resulted in an increase in storage modulus, glass transition temperature, Young's modulus, and tensile strength in the copolymers. However, both thermal stability and elongation of the copolymers decreased with increasing MV content.

The nanoparticles were synthesized by a co-precipitation method, followed by hydrothermal treatment; the route was optimized in order to obtain particles of small average diameter (45 nm). Polymeric nanofibers were obtained by the electrospinning technique and further subjected to ZnO modification by nanoparticle impregnation. SEM images confirmed the uniform distribution of ZnO nanoparticles adsorbed onto the nanofiber surface, the amount of which was estimated to be 4% w\/w, according to thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA).

An attempt to meet this crisis was carried out by a unique, microwave-assisted method which has enabled the generation of a novel Si, P co-doped carbon (SiPDC) for supercapacitor applications. The microwave-assisted method is useful in developing SiPDC at a rapid and economical fashion that does not employ any inert or reducing gases, but is high yielding. Varying proportions of precursor materials were utilized to generate four SiPDCs (SiPDC-1, SiPDC-2, SiPDC-3 and SiPDC-4) with varying contents of dopants as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) results. Surface area and pore size analysis revealed that SiPDC-2 has a surface area of 641.51 m(2) g(-1), abundant micropores, mesopores and macropores which are critical for electrical double layer capacitance (EDLC). Of all the SiPDCs, SiPDC-2 exhibited highest capacitance of 276 F g(-1) in 1 M H2SO4 and 244 F g(-1) in 6 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1).

The redox reaction of catechol on the graphite screen-printed electrodes modified with Ag@Pt-CNTs-CS applied as a probe for studying the immobilization and determination processes in immunosensor, due to enhanced electrocatalytic activity of Ag@Pt-CNTs for catechol. The results showed that this nanocomposite exhibited attractive electrocatalytic activity and also yielded a large capacity for antibody loading, which improved the amount of immobilized antibody. A decrease in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) responses was observed with increasing concentrations of TNF-alpha in standard and real samples due to its obstruction to the electrocatalytic oxidation of catechol by Ag@Pt-CNTs after binding to the surface of the electrode through interaction with the antibody.

Here we describe a model polymer-phospholipid hybrid membrane system exhibiting strong similarities to binary phospholipid mixtures, but with more robust membrane mechanics. A lamella-forming graft copolymer, PDMS-co-PEO (polydimethylsiloxane-co-polyethylene oxide) was blended with a high melting temperature phospholipid, DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), over a broad compositional range. The resulting giant hybrid unilamellar vesicles were compared qualitatively and quantitatively to analogous mixed phospholipid membranes in which a low melting temperature phospholipid, DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), was blended with DPPC. The mechanical properties of the hybrid vesicles, even when phase separated, were robust with high lysis stresses and strains approaching those of the pure copolymer vesicles. The temperature-composition phase diagram of the hybrid vesicles closely resembled that of the mixed phospholipids; with only slightly greater nonidealities in the hybrid compared with DOPC\/DPPC mixed membranes. In both systems, it was demonstrated that tension could be used to manipulate DPPC solidification into domains of patchy or striped morphologies that exhibited different tracer incorporation. The patch and stripe-shaped domains are thought to be different solid DPPC polymorphys: ripple and tilt (or gel). This work demonstrates that in mixed-phospholipid bilayers where a high-melting phospholipid solidifies on cooling, the lower-melting phospholipid may be substituted by an appropriate copolymer to improve mechanical properties while retaining the underlying membrane physics.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Treatment of cellulose bleaching effluents and their filtration permeates by anodic oxidation with H2O2 production","Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs), particularly those based on either cathodic electrogeneration of H2O2 or anodic oxidation (AO) via (OH)-O-center dot, have become attractive technological options for the complete detoxification of wastewaters. Their integration with separation pre-treatment such as ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) may be a plausible way to reduce processing time and costs. RESULTS: Raw effluents from the acid and alkaline elemental chlorine free bleaching stages of a hardwood-based kraft pulp mill, as well as their UF, NF and RO permeates, have been characterized and then treated by AO-H2O2 in a tank reactor with an air-diffusion cathode, which allowed efficient reduction of O-2,O- and a DSA-RuO2 or BDD anode at constant cell voltage (2-12V). Due to the complexity of the matrix, a larger H2O2 accumulation in the acid effluents was observed. DSA favoured the accumulation of ClO2- ions, whereas BDD allowed their further transformation into ClO3- owing to the larger oxidizing power of its physisorbed (OH)-O-center dot. The contribution of this species, along with H2O2 and active chlorine, accounted for the significant TOC abatement reached in the different individual and coupled treatments. CONCLUSIONS: AO-H2O2 and UF\/AO-H2O2 yielded similar mineralization levels (65-68%) for acid effluents, but lower energy consumption (EC) resulted in the latter process due to the lower conductivity of the permeates. NF\/AO-H2O2 coupling yielded the largest mineralization of alkaline effluents (96% instead of 75% obtained by AO-H2O2) with low EC.

Deacetylated chitosan (DAC) at 97% is used as a precursor to prepare two derivatives: N-propylsulfonic acid chitosan (SC), chitosan with zwitterionic pendant groups (ZWC). These derivatives increase the polar character of pure chitosan, and significantly improve its solubility. Likewise, they are thermally stable up to 220 degrees C, and their glass transition temperatures (T-g) are located in the region where they decompose, except for SC (T-g = 158 degrees C). The incorporation of the sulfobetaine and zwitterionic pendant groups improves the ionic conductivity by at least 2 orders of magnitude with respect to pure chitosan at 25 degrees C, without the use of plasticizers or further modifications. The salt addition (LiPF6 or LiClO4) to ZWC does not modify the conductivity, whence it is suggested that its increase is due to an electronic modification, such that the energy barriers for conducting the Li+ across the ZWC become decreased (i.e., charge dislocation), rather than a salt dissociation. This experimental finding is confirmed with density functional theory (DFT) calculations conducted with the SC and ZWC structures.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Water desalination via capacitive deionization: what is it and what can we expect from it?","Abstract":"Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an emerging technology for the facile removal of charged ionic species from aqueous solutions, and is currently being widely explored for water desalination applications.

The inner shell offers a much higher mechanical strength and electronic conductivity compared to common graphene aerogel. Then, MGA-n\/Si was embedded in the binder layer (outside shell) composed of tryptophan-functionalized graphene quantum dots (Trp-GQD) and sodium alginate. The introduction of Trp-GQD greatly improves the mechanical strength, elasticity and electronic conductivity of the outside shell.

In this context, a fundamentally different approach was adopted, and we have demonstrated the interplay of inherent substrate conductivity, defined chemical composition of cellular microenvironment, and intermittent delivery of electric pulses to drive mesenchymal stem cell differentiation toward osteogenesis. For this, conducting polyaniline (PANI) substrates were coated with collagen type 1 (Coll) alone or in association with sulfated hyaluronan (sHya) to form artificial extracellular matrix (aECM), which mimics the native microenvironment of bone tissue. Further, bone marrow derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were cultured on these moderately conductive (10(-4)10(-3) S\/cm) aECM coated PANI substrates and exposed intermittently to pulsed electric field (PEF) generated through transformer-like coupling (TLC) approach over 28 days. On the basis of critical analysis over an array of end points, it was inferred that Coll\/sHya coated PANI (PANI\/Coll\/sHya) substrates had enhanced proliferative capacity of hMSCs up to 28 days in culture, even in the absence of PEF stimulation. On the contrary, the adopted PEF stimulation protocol (7 ms rectangular pulses, 3.6 mV\/cm, 10 Hz) is shown to enhance osteogenic differentiation potential of hMSCs. Additionally, PEF stimulated hMSCs had also displayed different morphological characteristics as their nonstimulated counterparts. Concomitantly, earlier onset of ALP activity was also observed on PANI\/Coll\/sHya substrates and resulted in more calcium deposition. Moreover, real-time polymerase chain reaction results indicated higher mRNA levels of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, whereas the expression of other osteogenic markers such as Runt-related transcription factor 2, Col1A, and osteopontin exhibited a dynamic pattern similar to control cells that are cultured in osteogenic medium.

Gas-sensing measurements indicate that assembling nanocones decorated with nanothorns on NiO foil substrate is an effective strategy for simultaneously promoting the stability, reproducibility, and sensitivity of the sensor, because the NiO foil substrate as a whole can quickly and stably transfer electrons between the gas molecules and the sensing materials and the large specific surface area of both nanocones and nanothorns provide good accessibility of the gas molecules to the sensing materials. Moreover, p-type NiO, with majority charge carriers of holes, has higher binding affinity for the electron-donating ammonia, resulting in a significant increase in selectivity toward NH3 over other organic gases. Compared with the NiO nanowires and pure NiO nanocones, the heterogeneous NiO nanocones\/ZnO nanothorns exhibit less dependence on the temperature and humidity in response\/recovery speed and sensitivity of sensing NH3. Our investigation indicates that two factors are responsible for reducing the dependence on the gas sensing characteristics under various environmental conditions. One is that the n-type ZnO nanothorns growing on the surface of nanocones, with majority charge carriers of electrons, speed up adsorption and desorption of gas molecules. The other is that the abundant cone-shaped and thornlike superstructures on the substrate are favorable for constructing a hydrophobic surface, which prevents the gas sensing material from being wetted.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Phenolics and Polyphenolics from Melastomataceae Species","Abstract":"The Melastomataceae family, the seventh largest flowering plants, has been studied in several fronts of natural product chemistry, including terpenoids, simple phenolics, flavonoids, quinones, lignans and their glycosides, as well as a vast range of tannins or polyphenols.

In the present study, surface tension, turbidity, viscosity and electrophoretic mobility measurements were used to investigate the interactions of the cationic polyelectrolyte chitosan (Ch) and the oppositely charged anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in buffered water. Obtained results show the presence of interactions that lead to Ch\/SDS complexes formation at all investigated pH and for all investigated polymer concentrations. Mechanisms of interaction, as well as characteristics of formed Ch\/SDS complexes, are highly dependent on their mass ratio in the mixtures, while pH has no significant influence.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Quaternary alloy quantum dots with widely tunable emission - a versatile system to fabricate dual-emission nanocomposites for bio-imaging","Abstract":"Tuning the composition is an efficient strategy to control the photoluminescence (PL) emission of multiplex alloy quantum dots (QDs), just as the size is for binary QDs. Hence, in this paper, a quaternary alloy system was selected as a model. By controlling the composition, the quaternary QDs exhibit favorable, wide ranging composition-tuned PL emissions, while ZnS overcoating may further improve their PL quantum yields (QYs). Specifically, Zn-Ag-In-Se(ZAISe)\/ZnS QDs have a tunable PL peak from 550 (green) to 820 (NIR) nm with up to 70% PL QY; the parameters for Zn-Cu-In-Se(ZCISe)\/ZnS QDs are almost same as those for ZAISe\/ZnS QDs. In addition, these quaternary QDs were proven to be versatile for bioimaging, serving as a promising alternative for Cd- and Pb-based QDs, by using biodegradable RGD-modified N-succinyl-N'-octyl-chitosan (RGD-SOC) micelles as the water transfer agent to fabricate dual-emission nanocomposites.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Synthesis and degradable properties of cycloaliphatic epoxy resin from renewable biomass-based furfural","Abstract":"Biomass-based cycloaliphatic epoxy resin (Epoxide-A) with two epoxycyclohexyls linked with an acetal group was synthesized by utilizing furfural as a major raw material through a facile two-step preparation: synthesis of a diene precursor and subsequent epoxidation. The chemical structures of Epoxide-A and its precursor were confirmed by FTIR and H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Compared with the commercial cycloaliphatic epoxy resin ERL-4221, the cured Epoxide-A exhibits a similar glass transition temperature and thermal decomposition temperature but significantly higher mechanical modulus, shearing strength and lower coefficient of thermal expansion. More importantly, it is found that the cured Epoxide-A can readily degrade in an acidic aqueous solution due to the labile acetal linkages distributed within the cross-linked network, and the degradation apparently accelerates with the increase of the solution acidity. This peculiar degradation property provides a feasible after-treatment application for the products fabricated with epoxy resin, e.g., in the recovery of precious metal and carbon fiber from electronic waste and carbon fiber-reinforcing composite materials.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Host-Guest-Mediated DNA Templation of Polycationic Supramolecules for Hierarchical Nanocondensation and the Delivery of Gene Material","Abstract":"Only a few examples of monodisperse molecular entities that can compact exogenous nucleic acids into nanocomplexes, protect the cargo from the biological environment, facilitate cell internalization, and promote safe transfection have been reported up to date. Although these species open new venues for fundamental studies on the structural requirements that govern the intervening processes and their application in nonviral gene-vector design, the synthesis of these moieties generally requires a relatively sophisticated chemistry, which hampers further development in gene therapy. Herein, we report an original strategy for the reversible complexation and delivery of DNA based on the supramolecular preorganization of a -cyclodextrin-scaffolded polycationic cluster facilitated by bisadamantane guests. The resulting gemini-type, dual-cluster supramolecules can then undergo DNA-templated self-assembly at neutral pHvalue by bridging parallel DNA oligonucleotide fragments. This hierarchical DNA condensation mechanism affords transfectious nanoparticles with buffering capabilities, thus facilitating endosomal escape following cell internalization. Protonation also destabilizes the supramolecular dimers and consequently the whole supramolecular edifice, thus assisting DNA release. Our advanced hypotheses are supported by isothermal titration calorimetry, NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis, gel electrophoresis, dynamic light scattering, TEM, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, and transfection studies conducted in vitro and in vivo.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Nanomechanics of Poly(catecholamine) Coatings in Aqueous Solutions","Abstract":"Mussel-inspired self-polymerized catecholamine coatings have been widely utilized as a versatile coating strategy that can be applied to a variety of substrates. For the first time, nanomechanical measurements and an evaluation of the contribution of primary amine groups to poly(catecholamine) coatings have been conducted using a surface-forces apparatus. The adhesive strength between the poly(catecholamine) layers is 30-times higher than that of a poly(catechol) coating. The origin of the strong attraction between the poly(catecholamine) layers is probably due to surface salt displacement by the primary amine, - stacking (the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction of indolic crosslinks), and cation- interactions (the monopole-quadrupole interaction between positively charged amine groups and the indolic crosslinks). The contribution of the primary amine group to the catecholamine coating is vital for the design and development of mussel-inspired catechol-based coating materials.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Nanostructured Mn-based oxides for electrochemical energy storage and conversion","Abstract":"Batteries and supercapacitors as electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices are continuously serving for human life. The electrochemical performance of batteries and supercapacitors depends in large part on the active materials in electrodes. As an important family, Mn-based oxides have shown versatile applications in primary batteries, secondary batteries, metal-air batteries, and pseudocapacitors due to their high activity, high abundance, low price, and environmental friendliness. In order to meet future market demand, it is essential and urgent to make further improvements in energy and power densities of Mn-based electrode materials with the consideration of multiple electron reaction and low molecular weight of the active materials. Meanwhile, nanomaterials are favourable to achieve high performance by means of shortening the ionic diffusion length and providing large surface areas for electrode reactions. This article reviews the recent efforts made to apply nanostructured Mn-based oxides for batteries and pseudocapacitors. The influence of structure, morphology, and composition on electrochemical performance has been systematically summarized. Compared to bulk materials and notable metal catalysts, nanostructured Mn-based oxides can promote the thermodynamics and kinetics of the electrochemical reactions occurring at the solid-liquid or the solid-liquid-gas interface. In particular, nanostructured Mn-based oxides such as one-dimensional MnO2 nanostructures, MnO2-conductive matrix nanocomposites, concentration-gradient structured layered Li-rich Mn-based oxides, porous LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 nanorods, core-shell structured LiMnSiO4@C nanocomposites, spinel-type Co-Mn-O nanoparticles, and perovskite-type CaMnO3 with micro-nano structures all display superior electrochemical performance. This review should shed light on the sustainable development of advanced batteries and pseudocapacitors with nanostructured Mn-based oxides.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O over modified TiO2 nanofibers: Understanding the reduction pathway","Abstract":"Nanosized metal (Pt or Pd)-decorated TiO2 nanofibers (NFs) were synthesized by a wet impregnation method. CdSe quantum dots (QDs) were then anchored onto the metal-decorated TiO2 NFs. The photocatalytic performance of these catalysts was tested for activation and reduction of CO2 under UV-B light. Gas chromatographic analysis indicated the formation of methanol, formic acid, and methyl formate as the primary products. In the absence of CdSe QDs, Pd-decorated TiO2 NFs were found to exhibit enhanced performance compared to Pt-decorated TiO2 NFs for methanol production. However, in the presence of CdSe, Pt-decorated TiO2 NFs exhibited higher selectivity for methanol, typically producing similar to 90 ppmg(-1).h(-1) methanol. The CO2 photoreduction mechanism is proposed to take place via a hydrogenation pathway from first principles calculations, which complement the experimental observations.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Origin of Enhancing the Photocatalytic Performance of TiO2 for Artificial Photoreduction of CO2 through a SiO2 Coating Strategy","Abstract":"Artificial photosynthesis that mimics the natural photosynthetic protocol is now regarded as a promising candidate for chemical conversion of CO2 to renewable solar fuels. In this work, core-shell structured TiO2@SiO2 composites have been synthesized via a simple sol-gel method under ambient temperature and pressure and applied to photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O in the gas-phase under simulated solar light irradiation. The results show that compared with bare TiO2, TiO2@SiO2 composites exhibit significantly enhanced adsorption capacity for CO2 and facilitate photogenerated charge carrier separation and thereby enhanced photoactivity toward CO2 reduction. Although the insulating nature of SiO2 inhibits the charge injection from inner TiO2 core through the silica layer to the outer surface, the separation efficiency of charge carriers within the inner pore structure of TiO2@SiO2 is facilitated due to the as-formed Ti-O-Si bonds. In particular, TiO2@30%SiO2, which balances the combined influence of CO2 adsorption and charge carrier separation, acquires the best photoactivity and high selectivity for CO formation. This can be ascribed to the enriched density of adsorbed CO2 and relatively lower electron density on the reactive sites of the samples. In addition, in contrast to bare TiO2, the competitive process of H-2 formation is greatly inhibited over TiO2@SiO2 composites. It is hoped that our work could inspire ongoing interest in utilizing the SiO2 coating method as well as other proper core-shell strategies to tune the activity and selectivity of semiconductor-based materials for artificial photoreduction of CO2 to value-added solar fuels.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"An Alternative Reaction Course in O-Glycosidation with O-Glycosyl Trichloroacetimidates as Glycosyl Donors and Lewis Acidic Metal Salts as Catalyst: Acid-Base Catalysis with Gold Chloride-Glycosyl Acceptor Adducts","Abstract":"Gold(III) chloride as catalyst for O-glycosyl trichloroacetimidate activation revealed low affinity to the glycosyl donor but high affinity to the hydroxy group of the acceptor alcohol moiety, thus leading to catalyst acceptor adduct formation. Charge separation in this adduct, increasing the proton acidity and the oxygen nucleophilicity, permits donor activation and concomitant acceptor transfer in a hydrogen-bond mediated S(N)2-type transition state. Hence, the sequential binding between acceptor and catalyst and then with the glycosyl donor enables self-organization of an ordered transition-state. This way, with various acceptors, even at temperatures below -60 degrees C, fast and high yielding glycosidations in high anomeric selectivities were recorded, showing the power of this gold(III) chloride acid base catalysis. Alternative reaction courses via hydrogen chloride or HAuCl4 activation or intermediate generation of glycosyl chloride as the real donor could be excluded. With partially O-protected acceptors, prone to bidentate ligation to gold(III) chloride, particularly high reactivities and anomeric selectivities were observed.

The starting point of the processes is to produce raw silicon materials from a natural resource via mostly carbothermic reduction. However, this process is very complicated and SiO and SiC form as by-products. Further improvement of the carbothermic reduction process requires an understanding in real time of the reactions occurring and the weight change during heating. In particular, the behavior of the SiO by-product plays a major role in the production of silicon because the loss of Si is caused by the escape of SiO gas. In this study, we developed an in-situ weight measuring system for our induction heating furnace, and successfully suppressed much of the error in weight by improving the crucible configuration. The real-time monitoring of the crucible weight loss during the reaction may assist in understanding of the carbothermic reduction process in a more detailed fashion.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Aggregation-induced chirality, circularly polarized luminescence, and helical self-assembly of a leucine-containing AIE luminogen","Abstract":"Self-assembling of luminescent molecules into one-dimensional nanostructures is of particular interest in fabricating nanoscale electronic and photonic devices.

The microplatelets are made magnetically responsive to control their orientation and spatial distribution in the cement matrix via a magnetic field and to thus take full advantage of the expected reinforcing effect. Flexural and fracture toughness tests showed that composites exhibiting localized and aligned reinforcement architectures can be up to 50-60% stronger, stiffer and tougher than compositions with randomly distributed microplatelets. By targeting reinforcement at the largely unexploited microscale, the strength and toughness of current cement-based materials showing comparable porosities can be increased by two- to three-fold. This simple and effective approach allows for the reduction of the cement fraction in cementitious systems without impairing its final mechanical performance.

To gain control on the pore structure, three different methods were employed for the synthesis of an electrospinning-derived freestanding carbon nanofiber web. They are incorporation of a pore generator (i.e., tetraethyl orthosilicate) in the electrospinning step, physical activation (e.g., H2O or CO2), and hydrogen treatment. We observed finely tuned pore sizes ranging from 0.734 to 0.831 nm and accompanying changes in BET surface areas ranging from 1160 to 1624 m(2) g(-1). The entrapped TEOS within the electrospun organic nanofiber web provided high tuning ability of the pore structure in the following carbonization step, and decreased the activation energy of the pore formation. Both high specific capacitance (161 F g(-1)) and ultra-high energy density (246 W h kg(-1)) were achieved when the pore size on the surface of carbon nanofibers matched with the ionic size of the electrolyte.

This model predicts that modification of this functional group would alter conductance of the AmB ion channel. To test this hypothesis, the C3-hydroxyl group was synthetically deleted, and the resulting derivative, C3deoxyAmB (C3deOAmB), was characterized using multidimensional NMR experiments and single ion channel electrophysiology recordings. C3deOAmB possesses the same macrocycle conformation as AmB and retains the capacity to form transmembrane ion channels, yet the conductance of the C3deOAmB channels is 3-fold lower than that of AmB channels.

The electrodes were formed with o-BC or a-BC and a water based composite binder. The correlation between the physical properties of BC and electrochemical properties of these electrodes were carefully investigated in H2SO4 and aqueous LiN(SO2CF3)(2) electrolytes. The results obtained from cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectrometry and charge\/discharge measurements showed approximately a tenfold increase in the capacitance of the electrodes with the a-BC. Further analysis of the BC samples identified functional groups on the carbon surface of the a-BC which could be responsible for such a dramatic increase in the performance of the electrodes. The highest specific capacitances of 470 F g(-1) in 0.75 M H2SO4 and 335 F g(-1) in 3 M LiN(SO2CF3)(2) were achieved.

Design\/methodology\/approach - The paper presents a conceptual architecture and software platform that facilitates do-it-yourself reconfiguration of existing products incorporating 3D printing, mobile 3D sensor, augmented reality (AR) and Web technologies. Findings - This work shows that prosumer reconfiguration of consumer products is the major paradigm in the era of democratized production. The results suggest that this approach may be used in the consumer market to meet consumer preferences for adopting innovations without redundant consumption. Research limitations\/implications - Verification of the proposed conceptual approach is limited to the use of household consumer products. A critical mass of participants and product information are both necessary to achieve a sustainable ecosystem from the proposed platform. Intellectual property issues rely on the fair use of end-user production in this paper. Social implications - The proposed approach allows users to swap out consumer product parts or upgrade individual modules as innovations emerge, extending the lifecycles of consumer products and potentially reducing consumer waste. Originality\/value - There is a lack of work on facilitating the proliferation of practical 3D printing through prosumption in relation to existing consumer products.

Here, we report one-dimensional (1D) TiO2-C composite nanofibers for use as an anode for NIBs, which were fabricated via an electrospinning technique combined with optimized heat-treatment. The TiO2-C composite nanofibers are composed of tiny anatase TiO2 nanocrystals surrounded by and\/or embedded in the conducting carbon matrix. When tested in an electrochemical Na cell, the TiO2-C nanofiber electrode retained a high charge capacity of 140 mA h g(-1), even after 100 cycles at a current density of 60 mA g(-1), and it exhibited excellent rate-capability (105 mA h g(-1) at 3 A g(-1)), proving its feasibility as an NIB anode. The superior Na storage performance of the nanofiber anode is mainly attributed to the unique composite architecture, that is, a large number of active sites per volume due to the high aspect ratios and short lengths for Na transport through 1D nanofibers and TiO2 nanocrystals as well as highly conducting electron paths.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Design and development of a nanoemulsion system containing copper peptide by D-optimal mixture design and evaluation of its physicochemical properties","Abstract":"Copper peptide is an important compound used to prevent ageing; a process that leads to several unwanted aging signs such as wrinkles, sagging, pigmented spots and dryness. The D-optimal mixture design was used for optimizing the particle size of Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) nanoemulsions for topical delivery of copper peptide. Effects of formulation variables including VCO (10-20%, w\/w), Tween 80 : Pluronic PF68 (10-15%, w\/w), xanthan gum (0.5-1.0%, w\/w) and water (64.008-79.291), towards particle size as a response were studied. D-optimal mixture design analysis demonstrated that the variation in particle size as a response could be expressed as a quadratic function of the main components of the emulsion. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the quadratic polynomial model sufficiently fits the experimental data. The best combination of the composition factors that gave the optimum particle size was found to be VCO (10%, w\/w), T80 : PF68 (15%, w\/w), xanthan gum (0.867%, w\/w) and water (74.133%, w\/w). Under these optimum compositions, the actual particle size showed good agreement with predicted particle size with a residual standard error (RSE) less than 2%. The formulation containing copper peptide was successfully prepared with a particle size value of 120.7 nm, which was consistent with the result obtained by TEM. The final formulation also showed good conductivity and pH values as well as stability against phase separation. A rheology study demonstrates that the VCO nanoemulsion containing copper peptide exhibited shear thinning and pseudoplastic properties and showed more elastic rather than viscous characteristics due to the presence of a large linear viscoelastic region. Permeability test results showed that copper peptide in aqueous solution with and without penetration enhancer cannot be transported through the cellulose acetate membrane after 8 h application. The nanoemulsion increased the permeability of copper peptide with 21.89 +\/- 0.53% active matter release after 8 h application.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Profiles of Fatty Acids and the Main lipid Peroxidation Products of Human Atherogenic Low Density Lipoproteins","Abstract":"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), a worldwide leading cause of mortali0 and morbidity, are generated mainly by atherosclerosis. The serum fatty adds (FA) and some of their peroxidation products, such as 4-hydroxytrans-2-nonenal (4-HNE) and malondyaldehyde (MDA), are known risk factors for CVD. Ouraim was to determine in atherogenically-modified low-densiOpoproteins (LDL), either oxidized or glycated, the FA composition, quantify the levels of 4-HNE, MDA and of cholesterol's main oxidation product, 7-kethocholesterol (7-KC). Profiles of FA, conjugated dienes, 4-HNE, MDA and 7-KC were determined in native LDL (nLDL) isolated from blood donors from the Hematology Center, Bucharest, copper-oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and non-enzymatically glycated LDL (gLDL). The FA composition was determined by Gas Chromatography with a flame ionization detector and the conjugated dienes by absorbtion in UV at 234 nm. Free 4-HNE and 7-KC levels were determined by Gas-Chromatography Triple Quadrupol Mass Spectrometry in Electron Ionization mode and total MDA by reversed-phase Ultra High Performance Lichid Chromatography. Results showed that the polyunsaturated fatty adds (PUFAs) were totally reduced in oxLDL (except linoleic add) and decreased in gLDL, while the monounsaturated fatty acids remained almost unchanged in both oxLDL and gLDL. Lipid peroxidation products increased as follows: conjugated dienes were significantly increased both in gLDL (29%, p<0.05) and oxLDL (1.5 fold higher, p<0.01) compared to nLDL; free 4-HNE level in oxLDL (2.75 +\/- 1.01 nmoles\/mg protein) was 100 times the level in nLDL (0.02 +\/- 0.01 nmoles\/mg protein), while gLDL (0.05 +\/- 0.02 nmoles\/mg protein) had only twice the nLDL level; MDA levels in oxLDL were statistically increased (1.05 +\/- 0.44 nmoles\/mg protein) compared to nLDL (0.05 0.02 nmoles\/ mg protein) and to gLDL (0.19 +\/- 0.05 nmoles\/mg protein); 7-KC level was significantly increased in oxLDL (674.39 +\/- 207.70 nmoles\/mg protein) and gLDL (1.21 +\/- 0.32 nmoles\/mg protein) compared to nLDL (0.13 +\/- 0.04 nmoles\/mg protein). Our data demonstrate that the alteration of the FA composition of moded LDL has two negative consequences: (i the reduction of PUFA levels, most importantly the essential omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, and (ii) the increase of the main peroxidation products of FA and cholesterol such as conjugated dienes, free 4-HNE, MDA and 7-KC, transforming LDL into atherogenic lipoproteins.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Carr-Purcell Pulsed Electron Double Resonance with Shaped Inversion Pulses","Abstract":"Pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy allows the determination of distances, in the range of 1.5-8 nm, between two spin-labels attached to macromolecules containing protons. Unfortunately, for hydrophobic lipid-bound or detergent-solubilized because of a strongly reduced coherence time of the electron spins. Here membrane proteins, the maximum distance accessible is much lower, we introduce a pulse sequence, based on a Carr-Purcell decoupling scheme on the observer spin, where each pi-pulse is accompanied by a shaped sech\/tanh inversion pulse applied to the second spin, to overcome the dipolar interaction, allowing a substantially longer observation time window to be achieved. This increases the upper limit and accuracy of distances that can be determined in membrane protein complexes. We validated the method on a bis-nitroxide model compound and applied this technique to the trimeric betaine transporter BetP. Interprotomer distances as long as 6 nm could be reliably determined, which is impossible with the existing methods.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Biobased System Composed of Electrospun sc-PLA\/POSS\/Cyclodextrin Fibers To Remove Water Pollutants","Abstract":"In this work, a novel biobased system, characterized by specific features suitable for the removal of water pollutants, was developed.

The sc-PLA\/POSS-NH2 fibers, characterized by a submicrometric dispersion of the silsesquioxanes, underwent a grafting reaction with beta-cyclodextrin molecules, activated to nucleophilic substitution via monotosylation (CD-O-Ts). The reaction was first investigated on neat POSS-NH2 and optimized conditions were then applied for sc-PLA\/POSS-NH2 fibers. Indeed, IR and XPS measurements demonstrated the formation of a novel hybrid molecule, characterized by the linkage of the cyclodextrin to the silsesquioxane siliceous cage (POSS-NH-CD). Concerning the fibers, SEM measurements evidenced that the treated mats show a higher surface roughness than the neat ones, whereas by applying TGA analysis it was possible to evaluate the amount of the grafted cyclodextrin, which was found to be 3 wt %, that is a quantity correlated with the concentration of POSS-NH2 in the fibers (5 wt %). Moreover, the surface wettability of the fibers turned out to increase as a consequence of the surface grafting. Finally, UV measurements demonstrated the capacity of the novel synthesized hybrid molecule, based on PUSS and cydodextrin, to absorb water pollutants, by having chosen, as model compounds, alizarin red and 2-chlorophenol. Indeed, it was demonstrated that the grafting of CD on the surface of sc-PLA\/POSS-NH2 fibers enhanced the absorption capacity of the system.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"A unique solar radiation exfoliated reduced graphene oxide\/polyaniline nanofibers composite electrode material for supercapacitors","Abstract":"Solar radiation exfoliated reduced graphene oxide (SRGO) and polyaniline nanofibers (PANi NFs) containing composite is synthesized using the typical chemical oxidative polymerization.

Global gene regulators, including PhoP are important in regulating bacterial virulence and are good targets for developing attenuated vaccines against many pathogenic bacteria. However, the biological significance of phoP gene has not been identified in P. multocida. Here, we identified the phoP gene in P. multocida, and we evaluated the roles of phoP in P. multocida by deleting the phoP gene. The P. multocida phoP mutant exhibited similar growth curves and lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane protein profiles but displayed defective polymyxin resistance in vitro compared with the parent strain. Additionally, the phoP deletion resulted in decreased virulence. The LD50 of the D phoP mutant was 32- and 154-fold higher than the parent strain via the oral and intranasal routes, respectively. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that 161 genes were up-regulated and 173 genes were down-regulated in the absence of the phoP gene. Finally, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the D phoP mutant were evaluated. Immunized ducks produced significantly higher levels of serum IgY and bile IgA compared to the control ducks, and immunization with the D phoP mutant conferred 54.5% protection efficiency against challenge with the virulent P. multocida. This work provides a platform to dissect the function of phoP and develop a new vaccine against P. multocida.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"A coupled thermal and electrochemical study of lithium-ion battery cooled by paraffin\/porous-graphite-matrix composite","Abstract":"Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery cooling using a phase change material (PCM)\/compressed expanded natural graphite (CENG) composite is investigated, for a cylindrical battery cell and for a battery module scale. An electrochemistry model (average model) is coupled to the thermal model, with the addition of a one-dimensional model for the solution and solid diffusion using the nodal network method. The analysis of the temperature distribution of the battery module scale has shown that a two-dimensional model is sufficient to describe the transient temperature rise. In consequence, a two-dimensional cell-centred finite volume code for unstructured meshes is developed with additions of the electrochemistry and phase change. This two-dimensional thermal model is used to investigate a new and usual battery module configurations cooled by PCM\/CENG at different discharge rates. The comparison of both configurations with a constant source term and heat generation based on the electrochemistry model showed the superiority of the new design.

Also, because of the highly active nature of the sodium metal, the conventional room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery concept with the sodium-metal anode and elemental sulfur cathode imposes serious safety concerns. To overcome the above difficulties, we present here a RT Na-S system with an advanced membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) comprising a carbon-coated, presodiated Nafion membrane (Na-Nafion) and a sodium sulfide (Na2S) cathode. The Na-Nafion membrane provides a facile Na+-ion conductive path and serves as a cation-selective shield to prevent the migration of the polysulfides to the anode. The carbon coating on the Na-Nafion plays an upper-current-collector role and thereby improves the electrochemical utilization of the active Na2S. Employing Na2S as the cathode provides a pathway to develop the RT Na-S batteries with sodium metal-free anodes. The RT Na-S battery with the above MEA exhibits remarkably enhanced capacity and cyclability in contrast to the Na-S batteries with the conventional electrolyte-separator configuration. Mechanistic studies reveal that the suppression of polysulfide migration through the Na-Nafion is due to size and electronic effects.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Electrospun materials for lithium and sodium rechargeable batteries: from structure evolution to electrochemical performance","Abstract":"Electrospinning has been growing increasingly versatile as a promising method to fabricate one dimensional (1D) designed architectures for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).

Nevertheless, construction of TMP with abundant exposed active sites is of urgent concern and highly desirable for the HER. Herein, we report a novel strategy to configure integrated active site-enriched architectures (Fe2P-ND\/FG) composed of diiron phosphide (Fe2P) nanodots with a diameter of similar to 2.5 nm uniformly anchored on porous and fluffy graphene sheets (FG). The interconnected conductive networks within porous FG favor the formation of uniformly and highly dispersed Fe2P nanodots, finally helping the promotion of fast electrolyte ion and electron transfer during the electrochemical process. Compared with bulk Fe2P, these ultrasmall Fe2P nanodots lead to abundant exposed edges and atoms. Benefiting from the highly exposed active sites derived from Fe2P nanodots and superior electrical conductivity stemming from an interconnected graphene matrix, the as-made Fe2P-ND\/FG hybrids exhibit outstanding HER catalytic activity and stability. Overpotentials as low as 44 and 91 mV are required to achieve current densities of 2 and 10 mA cm(-2), respectively.

In this study, a multi-layer membrane with celecoxib-loaded poly(l-lactic acid)-polyethylene glycol (PELA) electrospun fibrous membrane as the outer layer, hyaluronic acid (HA) gel as middle layer, and PELA electrospun fibrous membrane as the inner layer was designed. The anti-adhesion efficacy of this multi-layer membrane was compared with a single-layer use in rabbit flexor digitorum profundus tendon model. The surface morphology showed that both PELA fibers and celecoxib-loaded PELA fibers in multi-layer membrane were uniform in size, randomly arrayed, very porous, and smooth without beads. Multi-layer membrane group had fewer peritendinous adhesions and better gliding than the PELA membrane group and control group in gross and histological observation. The similar mechanical characteristic and collagen expression of tendon repair site in the three groups indicated that the multi-layer membrane did not impair tendon healing.

The interesting morphology evolution of samples from NTs to NBs was reported with increasing amounts of CeO2. In addition, SnO2 particles existed on the surface of the CeO2 matrix to form diverse structures in the 1D nanofibers. The band gap of the composite oxides decreased with the addition of CeO2. Compared with other nanostructures, SnO2\/CeO2 NTs exhibited superior gas sensing properties, such as the highest response to ethanol. Due to the existence of Ce3+ and oxygen vacancies and the hollow structure, SnO2\/CeO2 NTs revealed great CO oxidation performance, indicating the enhanced interactions between the catalyst and the target gas. These excellent properties were attributed to the prominent 1D hollow morphology, the good dispersion of SnO2 nanoparticles on the surface of the CeO2 matrix, the ideal crystallinity, and the composite interactions between the two oxides.

Therefore, the design and fabrication of sensors for detecting trace H2S gas in the environment are highly desirable. However, it remains a challenge to develop gas sensors that can detect H2S at ppb concentration levels and at a relatively low temperature. Herein we developed a facile method to fabricate porous two-dimensional net-like SnO2\/ZnO heteronanostructures. Both the SnO2 and ZnO nanoparticles were significantly smaller in the net-like heteronanostructures than in net-like SnO2 and ZnO homonanostructures. Heterojunctions formed at the interfaces between SnO2 and ZnO-and, as a result, the net-like SnO2\/ZnO heteronanostructures-exhibited better H2S-sensing properties, including higher sensor response, better selectivity and long-term stability, than did the net-like SnO2 and ZnO homonanostructures, and other types of metal oxide-based nanocomposites.

Therefore, the net-like SnO2\/ZnO heteronanostructures have very promising applications in high-performance H2S sensors.

The resulting aerogels, e.g. NaV3O8, NaV6O15, and K0.25V2O5, exhibit excellent Li+ storage properties in terms of high specific capacity, good rate capability, and outstanding cyclic stability as cathodes for lithium batteries. Importantly, the NaV3O8 aerogel demonstrates an excellent long-life cyclic performance of 600 cycles at 1000 mA g(-1) with no capacity fading. To account for the mechanisms that affect the electrochemical properties, a systematic study is conducted. The superior performances may be due to the superior mechanical stability, good reversibility of lithium insertion\/deinsertion and excellent interior structural stability. It is believed that our strategy could probably be extended to prepare other metal vanadate aerogel materials with great promise for various applications.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Interconnected MnO2 nanoflakes assembled on graphene foam as a binder-free and long-cycle life lithium battery anode","Abstract":"Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a promising anode material because of its high theoretical capacity, environmental friendliness and abundant natural reserves. However, its application in lithium ion batteries is still hindered by rapid capacity fading and low rate performance resulting from large volume expansion and low conductivity. We construct a stable structure with ultrathin interconnected MnO2 nanoflakes (NFs) assembled on the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown graphene foam (GF) via a facile hydrothermal process. Without the use of any binder, conductive additives or any other current collector, the designed electrode benefits from shorter transport path, larger electrode\/electrolyte contact area, more stable structure to buffer volume expansion during cycling. As a result, the composites show increased cycle life and deliver a high capacity of about 1200 mAh g(-1)at the current density of 500 mA g(-1). after 300 cycles and a capacity higher than 500 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 5 A g(-1).

The binding material of the NE, styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), is partially substituted by conductive PEDOT-PSS. The soft carbon NE with 1.0 wt% PEDOT-PSS exhibits enhanced capacity retention of 64% at a current density of 5 C by lowering its electrical and electrochemical charge transfer resistance. The rate capability increased with increasing amounts of PEDOT-PSS, with no variation in the Li+ diffusivity. This improved electrochemical performance of the NE is also reflected in the LIC full-cell configuration. An LIC employing a 1.0 wt% PEDOT-PSS NE delivers 6.6 F at a high current density of 100 C, which is higher than the 6.0 F measured for the LIC with a bare NE. Moreover, the LIC with the 1.0 wt% PEDOT-PSS NE retains 85% of its initial capacitance even after 5000 cycles. These results are mainly attributed to the favourable electrical network formed by the incorporation of PEDOT-PSS into the NE. Thus, we believe that the incorporation of conductive PEDOT-PSS is a viable approach for obtaining high-power LICs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we propose a novel methodology of creating 3D nanofibrous networks, featured with neutralization and self-assembly of electrospun nanofibers by means of dual electrospinning from oppositely charged polymer jets. Using a fine-tuned upward airflow from a controllable heat source, we have successfully counterbalanced the gravity as well as the electrostatic force acting on the inflated intertwined jets clusters, which permits the mass production of 3D nanofibrous materials. We also experimentally measured sound absorption coefficients of the 3D nanofibrous networks in a standing wave tube and observed a nontrivial improvement of sound absorption in the audible frequencies ranging from 400 to 900 Hz by comparing with commercial muffler materials.

The viscosity enhancement at low concentrations of clay (r5%) exceeded by a factor of 50 the increase obtainable with conventional fillers. However, the effect of the nanoclay on the local dynamics, including the glass transition temperature, was quite small. All materials herein conformed to density-scaling of the reorientation relaxation time of the PCB for a common value of the scaling exponent. A new relaxation process was observed in the mixtures, associated with PCB molecules in proximity to the clay surface. This process has an anomalously high dielectric strength, suggesting a means to exploit nanoparticles to achieve large electrical energy absorption. This lower frequency dispersion has a weaker dependence on pressure and density, consistent with dynamics constrained by interactions with the particle surface.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"For progress in natural science: Materials international investigations of structural phase transformation and THz properties across metal insulator transition in VO2\/Al2O3 epitaxial films","Abstract":"Vanadium dioxide (VO2) epitaxial thin films on (0001)-oriented Al2O3 substrates were prepared using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering techniques.

Both the lattice constants and THz transmission exhibited a similar and sharp transition that was similar to that observed for the electrical resistance. Consequently, the MIT of the VO2\/Al2O3 epitaxial films should be co-triggered by the structural phase transition and electronic transition.

Structural elucidation of these lignin samples was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), high-performance anionexchange chromatography (HPAEC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), 2D heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy nuclear magnetic resonance (2D HSQC NMR), and derivatization followed by reductive cleavage (DFRC). The results showed that the separated lignin fractions possessed higher yields and purities than milled wood lignin (MWL). From the results of molecular weight, DFRC and 2D NMR analysis, it was also found that the lignin component from cotton stalk was a G-S type unit analogous to hardwood, and remarkable degradation and repolymerization occurred on lignin in this acid system, which led to more condensed and lower molecular weight lignin than MWL. Particularly, under the condition of GVL\/H2O 80\/20, the cleavages of aryl-ether bonds dramatically happened, resulting in the least amount of beta-O-4' linkages. Considering the concept of biorefinery, the one-pot acid GVL\/H2O system with 80\/20 GVL\/H2O could be an attractive method for the simple and efficient recovery of lignin and sugars simultaneously from agricultural wastes.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Fast and one-pot synthesis of silica aerogels via a quasi-solvent-exchange-free ambient pressure drying process","Abstract":"A very fast (less than 2 h) and one-pot synthetic strategy was developed for the synthesis of silica aerogels. Organic silica gel was first formed under basic condition by adding a predetermined amount of hexane to a freshly prepared silica sol. After aging at elevated temperature for several minutes, the organogel was mechanically crushed and vigorously stirred in a mixture of trimethylchlorosilane and hexane. Finally, silica aerogel was produced by drying the hydrophobized organogel at temperatures higher than 180 degrees C. The effects of gelation conditions, amount of modification agents, and drying temperatures on the physical properties of the silica aerogels were investigated. The N-2 adsorption and desorption measurements indicated that high BET surface areas (up to 725.8 m(2)\/g) could be obtained for the aerogels sintering at 350 degrees C, while that of the silica aerogels dried at 180 degrees C were relative lower (from 379.4 to 564.8 m(2)\/g based on the modification conditions). Similar trend was also found in the thermal conductivities of the aerogels, e.g., lower values of thermal conductivity (similar to 0.025 W\/mK) were obtained for the sintering samples, while that of the samples without sintering were relative higher (similar to 0.034 W\/mK). In summary, a fast ambient pressure drying method has been developed, which show a great potential to synthesize silica aerogels in the industrial scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Three different sandwiches, SW1 (thickness of top and bottom FRP skin: 3.15 mm each with 10 mm thick PPHC), SW2 (thickness of top and bottom FRP skin: 1.575 mm each with 5 mm thick PPHC), SW3 (thickness of top and bottom FRP skin: 1.575 mm each with 10 mm thick PPHC) were fabricated for conducting experimental work. In order to study the effect of fiber orientation of the skin on the natural frequency and loss factors, five different orientations (all 0 degrees, +\/-30 degrees, +\/-45 degrees, +\/-60 degrees and all 90 degrees) were considered. An impulse technique was used to calculate the natural frequency and loss factor of the composites. The natural frequency and loss factor were also computed theoretically and compared. As the in-plane load of the strong FRP skins imposes on the soft honeycomb core under dynamic condition, it causes a large transverse shear deformation on the core. This shear deformation leads to a high energy dissipation\/loss factor of the sandwich. At the 0 degrees fiber oriented sandwich, the loss factor value (eta = 0.0234) becomes significantly higher without losing its natural frequency (stiffness) value (f(n) = 142.12 Hz), which is not so in the case of FRP composites having the loss factor (eta) value of 0.00218 and the natural frequency value (f(n)) of 114.23 Hz.

Permeability, diffusion and sorption coefficients of O-2, N-2 and synthetic air components were estimated for homogeneous and heterogeneous membranes using the Time Lag method based on constant pressure permeation technique. The microstructure studies and the phase analysis of magnetic membranes were also performed using SEM and XRD. The influence of magnetic parameters, like coercivity, remanence and saturation magnetization of created membranes on the gas transport properties was studied. The results showed that their coercivity depended on composition and microstructure of the magnetic powder. On the other hand, remanence and saturation magnetization increased with the increase of the powder addition in the membrane. It was found that the magnetic membrane's gas transport properties were improved with the increase of membrane's remanence, saturation magnetization and magnetic particle filling. The decrease in powder particle size and associated increase of the membrane's coercivity also positively influenced the gas transport and separation properties of investigated membranes. It was observed that the magnetic ethylcellulose and poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) membranes had higher gas permeability, while their permselectivity and solubility coefficient values were rather maintained or slightly increased. The results also showed that the magnetic powder content enhanced significantly gas diffusivity in EC and PPO membranes.

Upon addition of the gold chloride solution, the nucleation process is initiated and both types of particles, i.e., isotropic spherical and anisotropic gold nanotriangles, are formed simultaneously. As it was not possible to produce monodisperse nanotriangles with such a one-step procedure, the anisotropic nanoparticles needed to be separated from the spherical ones.

Previous studies showed that administration of FVIII in the presence of phosphatidyl serine (PS) reduced the development of anti-FVIII antibodies in HA mice. However, the impact of PS-mediated effects on immunological memory, such as generation of memory B-cells, is not clear. The effect of PS on memory B-cells was therefore investigated using adoptive transfer approach in FVIII-\/- HA mice. Adoptive transfer of memory B-cells from a PS-FVIII-treated group to naive mice followed by challenge of the recipient mice with FVIII showed a significantly reduced anti-FVIII antibody response in the recipient mice, compared with animals that received memory B-cells from free FVIII and FVIII-charge matched phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) group. The decrease in memory B-cell response is accompanied by an increase in FoxP3 expressing regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Flow cytometry studies showed that the generation of Tregs is higher in PS-treated animals as compared with FVIII and FVIII-PG treated animals. The PS-mediated hyporesponsiveness was found to be antigen-specific. The PS-FVIII immunization showed hyporesponsiveness toward FVIII rechallenge but not against ovalbumin (OVA) rechallenge, an unrelated antigen. This demonstrates that PS reduces immunologic memory of FVIII and induces antigen-specific peripheral tolerance in HA mice.

The differences are even more dramatic when comparing measurements in conventional Transwell systems with those obtained in microfluidic systems. Our goal in this work was therefore to enhance the fidelity of TEER measurements in microfluidic organs-on-chips, specifically using direct current (DC) measurements of TEER, as this is the most widely used method reported in the literature. Here we present a mathematical model that accounts for differences measured in TEER between microfluidic chips and Transwell systems, which arise from differences in device geometry. The model is validated by comparing TEER measurements obtained in a microfluidic gut-on-a-chip device versus in a Transwell culture system. Moreover, we show that even small gaps in cell coverage (e.g., 0.4%) are sufficient to cause a significant (similar to 80%) drop in TEER.

The phenotypic markers of osteoblasts such as mineralization and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were higher on MSF in the presence of induction media when compared to MSF in the presence of normal media (p < 0.05). Upregulation of osteoblast specific genes (osteonectin, osteocalcin & alkaline phosphatase) suggests the potential of MSF to support osteogenic differentiation even in the absence of induction media (p < 0.05). In vitro results indicate that the nanotopography of MSF provided a favorable milieu for adhesion and proliferation of BM-MSCs. Further, the combination of the biomimetic nature of MSF, dissolution of silica ions (chemical cues) and biochemical cues presents a stable microenvironment for the differentiation of BM-MSCs into osteogenic lineage. In conclusion, the synergy of adhesion and proliferation cues in MSF along with suitable biochemical cues could be a promising design strategy to develop scaffolds for orchestrated bone healing.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"RESEARCH ON PREPARATION OF ETHANOL FUEL BY LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOMASS","Abstract":"Lignin separation two-step pretreatment methods were investigated using waste corn stover.

Finally, scaffolds were seeded with fibroblasts to evaluate biological properties and to demonstrate tissue growth. In addition, the toxicity of PCL scaffold on hFFs cells was explored with Live\/Dead staining. The morphological characterization of PCL scaffolds showed highly aligned micro- and nanofibrous morphology with porosity reaches to 66% and uniform diameter ranges from 200 nm to 1.4 mu m depending on PCL concentration, solvent and applied voltage. The FTIR results indicated that the micro\/nanofibers are almost the same for bulk PCL. The DSC results confirmed the semi-crystalline nature of PCL with crystallinity and temperature melting of microfibrous scaffold higher than that of the nanofibrous ones. The Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the PCL micro- and nanofibers have a single stage thermal degradation with higher decomposition temperature of microfibrous PCL scaffolds compared to the nanofibrous one. The mechanical test results indicated that the microfibrous scaffolds have an acceptable mechanical behavior for cell culture technology.

Two different types of cellulose nanofibers, which are nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and bacterial cellulose (BC), were prepared under various mechanical treatment times and then incorporated into the PVA prior to the fabrication of composite films. It was found that tensile modulus of the PVA film increased with nanofibers content at the expense of its percentage elongation value. DSC thermograms indicate that percentage crystallinity of PVA increased after adding 2-4 wt% of the fibers. This contributed to the better mechanical properties of the composites. Tensile toughness values of the PVA\/BC nanocomposite films were also superior to those of the PVA\/NFC system containing the same fiber loading. SEM images of the composite films reveal that tensile fractured surface of PVA\/BC experienced more ductile deformation than the PVA\/NFC analogue.

Accordingly, much interest has been generated to pursue a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental yet elusive double layer structure at the electrode\/electrolyte interface. In this paper, we carried out comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations to obtain a comprehensive picture of how ion type, solvent properties, and charging conditions affect the EDL structure at the graphene electrode surface, and thereby its contribution to capacitance. We show that different symmetrical monovalent aqueous electrolytes M+X- (M+ = Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+; X- = F-, Cl-, and I-) indeed have distinctive EDL structures. Larger ions, such as, Rb+, Cs+, Cl-, and I-, undergo partial dehydration and penetrate through the first water layer next to the graphene electrode surfaces under charging. As such, the electrical potential distribution through the EDL strongly depends on the ion type. Interestingly, we further reveal that the water can play a critical role in determining the capacitance value. The change of dielectric constant of water in different electrolytes largely cancels out the variance in electric potential drop across the EDL of different ion type. Our simulation sheds new lights on how the interplay between solvent molecules and EDL structure cooperatively contributes to capacitance, which agrees with our experimental results well.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Bio-inspired hollow activated carbon microtubes derived from willow catkins for supercapacitors with high volumetric performance","Abstract":"A novel bio-inspired hollow activated carbon microtubes (HACMs) was prepared from low-cost, renewable biomass willow catkins by low temperature pre-carbonization combined with KOH chemical activation and used as supercapacitor electrode materials.

While the specific capacity of nanostructured TiP materials was found to be not sensitive to the interlayer spacing, the specific capacity of coarse grained bulk TiP materials was significantly increased as the interlayer spacing was increased with the intercalation of water molecules in the layered host structure. These results indicate that interlayer spacing may not be the primary factor for Na-ion diffusion in nanostructured materials, where many interstitials are available for Na-ion diffusion. It is shown that nanostructured TiP materials can deliver excellent rate capability, and long term cycle stability with stable reversible capacity without the need of interlayer spacing expansion.

Moreover, the microparticle structure also endowed the CGs with high adsorption kinetics as the adsorption equilibrium for all pollutants was commonly reached within 30 min. The adsorption mechanisms for dyes were due to both electrostatic and pi-pi interactions, while those for heavy metals were the synergistic effect of electrostatic interactions, surface complexation and ion exchange. Further investigation indicated that the adsorption isotherms and kinetics can be well fitted by the Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order model, respectively.

The effects of NaOH-delignification, autohydrolysis and their combination at different severities were analyzed by determining the pore size distribution (DSC-thermoporometry), the cellulose surface area and the accessible phenolic hydroxyls on the lignin surface (adsorption of Congo Red and Azure B; ATR-FTIR) and crystallinity (WAXD). The correlation of these factors with initial and overall enzymatic hydrolyzability was studied and further arranged in order through principal component analysis. The major positive factors affecting hydrolyzability were the cellulose surface area and the accessibility of the pore system, while the lignin content was the major negative factor accompanied by cellulose crystallinity. Autohydrolysis effectively increased the cellulose surface area by hemicellulose dissolution, but the high lignin content associated with small pores led to a lower hydrolyzability compared to delignified straw. Besides the removal of lignin, delignification led to a more accessible pore structure, which was supported by the remaining hemicellulose. Additionally, delignification increased the hydrophilicity of the remaining lignin, which also increased hydrolyzability. All pretreatments decreased cellulose crystallinity, which particularly increased the initial hydrolysis, and also improved the final carbohydrate conversion. The established weighed order of the factors behind enzymatic carbohydrate conversion is an important milestone in the path towards more efficient lignocellulosic sugar utilization in biorefineries.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Removal of lead, copper, cadmium, zinc, and nickel from aqueous solutions by alkali-modified biochar: Batch and column tests","Abstract":"Engineered biochar was obtained through slow pyrolysis of hickory wood and then further modified with NaOH.

Lignin with a lower syringyl\/guaiacyl ratio tends to form more cross-linkages along with higher viscosity values, higher molecular weight and larger amounts of condensed bonds.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"A Novel Graphene Foam for Low and High Strains and Pressure Sensing Applications","Abstract":"We are reporting the formation of free-standing graphene foam (GF) via a novel two-step process, in which a polyurethane (PU) foam is first dip-coated with graphene oxide (GO) and subsequently the dried GO-coated-PU is heated in nitrogen atmosphere at 1000 degrees C. During the pyrolysis of the GO-coated-PU, GO is reduced to GF whereas PU is simultaneously decomposed and released completely as volatiles in a step wise mass-loss mechanism. Morphology of the formed GF conforms to that of the pure PU foam as indicated by the scanning electronic micrographs. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was successfully infiltrated inside the GF to form flexible and stretch-able conductors. The GF-PDMS composite was tested for it's pressure and strain sensing capabilities. It is shown that a 30% compressive strain changes resistance of the GF-PDMS composite to about 800% of it's original value. Since density of the formed GF is tunable, therefore, the pressure\/strain sensivity of the GF-PDMS composite is also tunable.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Bi-component inorganic oxide nanofibers from gas jet fiber spinning process","Abstract":"Nanometer size bi-component semiconducting metal oxide (SMO) fibers with tailored morphology are fabricated via a Gas Jet Fiber (GJF) spinning process using a polymer template in conjunction with conventional precursor sol-gel chemistry.

Both challenges have been simultaneously addressed in this study by hybridizing the two nanomaterials through melt compounding to develop elastomer\/graphene platelet\/MWCNT (3-phase) composites, where MWCNTs were fixed at 2.8 vol% (5 wt%) for all fractions. We investigated the composites' structure and properties, and compared the 3-phase composites with elastomer\/graphene platelet (2-phase) composites. MWCNTs may bridge graphene platelets (GnPs) and promote their dispersion in the matrix, which would provide more interface area between the matrix and the fillers. MWCNTs worked supplementally to GnPs by forming conductive networks, where MWCNTs acted as long nanocables to transport electrons and stress while GnPs served as interconnection sites between the tubes forming local conductive paths. This produced a percolation threshold of electrical conductivity at 2.3 vol% for 3-phase composites, 88% lower than that of 2-phase composites. At 26.7 vol% of total filler content (MWCNTs + GnPs), tensile strength, Young's modulus and tear strength showed respectively 303%, 115%, 155% further improvements over those of 2-phase composites. These improvements are originated from the synergistic effect between GnPs and MWCNTs. The conducting elastomeric composites developed would potentially open the door for applications in automotive and aerospace industries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, common practice centers on assembly with chemically reduced graphene oxide sheets, which have a tendency to severely aggregate during processing. More direct and facile is the LbL assembly of graphene oxide (GO) sheets and their subsequent electrochemical reduction. Here, we demonstrate porous (void fraction = 0.625) LbL electrodes comprised of electrochemically reduced GO (ERGO) sheets and polyaniline nanofibers (PANI NFs) for use in non-aqueous energy storage systems. Our approach is also promising for deposition onto complex surfaces, as demonstrated here by the successful assembly onto cotton fabric. Both PANI NFs and ERGO sheets store charge, bear conductivity, and provide a highly porous architecture, which facilitates the mass transport of ions. The nature of PANI NF\/GO LbL assembly and growth is first presented, which we find to be affected by assembly pH. The confirmation of the electrochemical reduction step is then discussed, followed by the electrochemical performance of the resulting electrodes in a non-aqueous lithium metal battery. Capacity varies from 85 to 184 mA h cm(-3) (188 to 461 mA h g(-1)) at 0.1 A g(-1) (electrode mass basis), depending on the electrode thickness.

With a vision to transform this lab-based technique into a more-durable embodiment, we investigate the use of a polymer-based organogel to encapsulate DIBs within a more-solid material matrix to improve their handling and portability. Specifically, a temperature-sensitive organogel formed from hexadecane and poly[styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-styrene] (SEBS) triblock copolymer is used to replace the liquid solvent that surrounds the lipid-coated droplets to establish a novel liquid-in-gel DIB system. Through specific capacitance measurements and single-channel recordings of the pore forming peptide alamethicin, we verify that the structural and functional membrane properties are retained when DIBs are assembled within SEBS organogel. In addition, we demonstrate that organogel encapsulation offers improved handling of droplets and yields DIBs with a near 3x higher bilayer durability, as quantified by the lateral acceleration required to rupture the membrane, compared to liquid-in-liquid DIBs in oil. This encapsulated DIB system provides a barrier against contamination from the environment and offers a new material platform for supporting multilayered DIB-based devices as well as other digital microfluidic systems that feature water droplets in oil.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Self-assembled three-dimensional graphene-based materials for dye adsorption and catalysis","Abstract":"A novel one-step strategy is proposed to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) graphene hydrogel (GH) by simultaneous self-assembly and reduction of graphene oxide (GO) at 90 degrees C under atmospheric pressure, using L-cysteine (L-Cys) as both templating and reducing agent. The preparation process can be completed within 3 h without producing any contamination, which is a fast, facile, economical and green method for the fabrication of GH. The freeze-dried product - graphene aerogel (GA) - has high mechanical strength and thermal stability, with hierarchical pore structure and large specific surface area. More importantly, the as-prepared GA exhibits outstanding adsorption capacity towards organic dyes, which could be a potential candidate for efficient adsorbents in water purification. In addition, the established method is successfully extended to the preparation of platinum nanoparticle (PtNP)-loaded 3D graphene materials via one-step simultaneous reduction and assembly of metal ions and GO. The as-obtained PtNPs\/GA with free-standing structure can act as a heterogeneous catalyst for the chemical reduction of p-nitroaniline, which shows excellent catalytic activity.

We performed a laboratory-scale life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the various routes of the entire production process from an environmental perspective. The results indicate that the electrospinning process has a higher impact than the alternative wet spinning process under the conditions described. Furthermore, to improve the liberation process of the microfibrillated cellulose, the enzymatic treatment step requires development; this could be through optimization of energy use in the heating process, mainly by reducing heat loss and water use.

The EDW jet is stretched into tightened state by the drag force from moving collector, when moving speed of collector is higher than deposition velocity of jet. The drag force from the moving collector provides an extra force to stretch the charged jet, which promotes the stability and decreases the diameter of direct-written fiber. The whipping and bending motion of jet can be overcome by the drag force, and then, straight orderly fibers are direct-written along the trajectory of collector. The falling jet would be also deviated from the extension line of spinneret by the drag force. As the collector velocity increases from 10 to 1000 mm\/s, the average line width of direct-written microfiber decreases from 18.89 to 0.89 mu m. The thickness of microfiber ranges from 100 nm to 1.5 mu m. The moving collector leads to large deviation of charged jet. The tightened charged jet has good resistance against the interference of charge repulsion force, which helps to direct-write orderly nanofiber. During the EDW process, the mechanical stretching force had provided an excellent function to control the morphology and deposition pattern of micro-\/nanofiber.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Uniform distribution of low content BaTiO3 nanoparticles in poly(vinylidene fluoride) nanocomposite: toward high dielectric breakdown strength and energy storage density","Abstract":"BaTiO3\/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (BT\/PVDF) composite material, a promising dielectric material for capacitor, has recently attracted much attention because of the promising dielectric performance and its abundant availability. Insufficient control of the hierarchal morphology of the blend has yielded a precipitous decline in breakdown strength at high BT nanoparticles volume fractions. Here, we demonstrate that breakdown strength and energy storage density can be increased up to higher value by creating uniform distribution of low content of BT nanoparticles in PVDF matrix. The dielectric properties of BT\/PVDF nanocomposite were measured as a function of BT nanoparticles loading. The nanocomposite displayed a 150% increase in dielectric breakdown strength and energy density increased to more than triple that of the pure PVDF even at the 1 vol% BT nanoparticles loading. It was attributed to the uniform distribution of low content BT nanoparticles in PVDF matrix, which lead to superior dielectric breakdown strength and energy storage density than those of composites filled with high content of BT nanoparticles. Furthermore, the nanocomposites films with low content of fillers were more flexible and cost-effective. The finding based on this research provides a low-cost method to achieve high performance in capacitor.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Porous carbon nanofibers formed in situ by electrospinning with a volatile solvent additive into an ice water bath for lithium-sulfur batteries","Abstract":"The in situ formation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers with a porous structure was achieved by electrospinning ternary PAN\/N,N'-dimethylformamide (DMF)\/chloroform (CHCl3), and ternary PAN\/DMF\/tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution systems into a glass dish filled with ice water. These porous carbon nanofibers (pCNFs) are both mesoporous and microporous, and attained high specific surface areas without the requirement of physical or chemical activation, which is mainly due to the in situ evaporation of the volatile solvent additive and the dissolution of the solvent in the ice water bath.

XRD and TEM analysis revealed that the the ultrafine nanoparticles were of size 2-58 nm. Crystallinity of the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles in the as-dried condition with the particle size similar to 2-3 nm was confirmed from the presence of a lattice fringe in the HRTEM image. VSM measurements showed that a superparamagnetic\/ferromagnetic transition occurs with increasing particle size, which was further confirmed by Mossbauer spectroscopy. The nickel ferrite nanoparticles with optimum particle size of 10 nm were then coated with materials commonly used for biomedical applications, i.e. chitosan and PEG, to form homogeneous suspensions. The hydrodynamic diameter and the polydispersity index (PDI) were analyzed by dynamic light scattering at the physiological temperature of 37 degrees C and found to be 187 nm and 0.21 for chitosan-coated nanoparticles and 285 nm and 0.32 for PEG-coated ones. The specific loss power of rf induction heating by the set-up for hyperthermia and r(2) relaxivity by the nuclear magnetic resonance were determined. The results of induction heating measurements showed that the temperature attained by the nanoparticles of size 10 nm and concentration of about 20 mg ml(-1) was >70 degrees C (for chitosan) and >64 degrees C (for PEG). It has been demonstrated that the required temperature for hyperthermia heating could be tuned by tuning the particle size, shape and magnetization and the concentration of solution.

CMC and EC are both biodegradable nontoxic materials, but have contrasting properties. CMC is a charged water-soluble polymer, while EC is an uncharged interfacially active water-insoluble polymer. The simple preparative method does not consume unnecessary chemical reagents and produces no waste material. The composite particles prepared by dehydrating emulsion droplets are readily dispersed in organic media due to its biwettable surface terminated with interfacially active EC molecules, which allows composite particles to preferentially adsorb at the oil water droplet interface. The surface of composite particles, furthermore, is water-permeable, which allows water to be absorbed from emulsified droplets.

Designing materials that have similar properties is challenging because of the need to assess complex deformation mechanisms. In order to shed more light on architectural possibilities of biopolymer fibrous networks, we propose a numerical study that relates the fibre arrangement to the elastic modulus of a gelatin scaffold obtained using electrospinning. The adopted approach is based on the virtual designing of scaffolds using all possible combinations of Euler angles that define fibre orientations including preferable alignment. The generated networks are converted into a finite element model and the predicted elastic behaviour is examined. Predictions show that the fibre alignment achieved experimentally in biopolymer fibrous networks is for most of the fibres exhibiting an orthotropic behaviour. Some particular combinations of Euler angles allow transverse isotropic architectures while only limited cases are isotropic. A large sensitivity of Young's moduli to Euler angles is achieved describing multiple scenarios of independent anisotropic behaviours. An anisotropy ratio of the elastic behaviour is suggested based on a suitable combination of elastic moduli. Such a ratio exhibits a wide variation depending on individual and coupled effects of Euler angles. The finite element model predicts 2D, 3D and 4D maps representing all possible configurations of fibre alignment and their consequences on elastic behaviour. The predicted fibre orientation representing the observed anisotropic behaviour of electrospun gelatin networks demonstrates unbalanced contributions of in-plane and out-of plane fibres for a large range of processing conditions.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Simultaneous Orthogonal Dual-Click Approach to Tough, in-Situ-Forming Hydrogels for Cell Encapsulation","Abstract":"The use of tough hydrogels as biomaterials is limited as a consequence of time-consuming fabrication techniques, toxic starting materials, and large strain hysteresis under deformation.

The gelation proceeds with disproportionation of GO yielding a large amount of CO2 (about a quarter of the original mass of GO), organic acidic fragments, and CO. The CO, that is formed is trapped in the hydrogel creating macroscopic voids which can lead to cracking of the hydrogel during compression. We were able to quantify the amount of CO2 produced in situ by adding ammonia during the synthesis, and converting CO2 into ionic carbonate species that we could easily quantify by titration. We used titration to evaluate the formation of organic acidic fragments too and evaluated the amount of H2O and CO produced by thermogravimetric analysis and mass balance. The conversion of CO2 into ionic species allowed us to produce void-free hydrogels which remain structurally stable after extensive compression. However, such hydrogels on average showed lower mechanical strength and electrical conductivity than the hydrogels with voids. This is a result of the difference in chemistry and morphology between hydrogels reduced under acidic pH and basic pH. Our work provides for the first time a clear quantitative estimate of CO2 evolution and organic fragment formation during hydrothermal reduction of GO, an overall picture of the reaction products, and a deepened understanding of the conditions that can be used to prepare stronger and more conductive graphene hydrogels and aerogels.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Advancing the Chemistry of CuWO4 for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation","Abstract":"CONSPECTUS: Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells are an ongoing area of exploration that provide a means of converting solar energy into a storable chemical form (molecular bonds). In particular, using PEC cells to drive the water splitting reaction to obtain H-2 could provide a clean and sustainable route to convert solar energy into chemical fuels. Since the discovery of catalytic water splitting on TiO2 photoelectrodes by Fujishima and Honda, significant efforts have been directed toward developing high efficiency metal oxides to use as photocatalysts for this reaction. Improving the efficiency of PEC cells requires developing chemically stable, and highly catalytic anodes for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER). This water oxidation half reaction requires four protons and four electrons coupling in two bond making steps to form O-2, which limits the rate. Our group has accelerated efforts in CuWO4 as a candidate for PEC OER chemistry. Its small band gap of 2.3 eV allows for using visible light to drive OER, and the reaction proceeds with a high degree of chemoselectivity, even in the presence of more kinetically accessible anions such as chloride, which is common to seawater. Furthermore, CuWO4 is a chemically robust material when subjected to the highly oxidizing conditions of PEC OER. The next steps for accelerating research using this (and other), ternary phase oxides, is to move beyond reporting the basic PEC measurements to understanding fundamental chemical reaction mechanisms operative during OER on semiconductor surfaces. In this Account, we outline the process for PEC OER on CuWO4 thin films with emphasis on the chemistry of this reaction, the reaction rate and selectivity (determined by controlled-potential coulometry and oxygen-detection experiments). We discuss key challenges with CuWO4 such as slow kinetics and the presence of an OER-mediating mid-gap state, probed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We propose that this mid-gap state imparts the observed chemoselectivity of OER on CuWO4. We introduce insights into the chemical mechanism of PEC OER on CuWO4 using Tafel analysis of electrochemical polarization. We measure Tafel slopes of similar to 161 mV\/dec, showing that PEC OER proceeds at a slower rate on CuWO4 than on common electrocatalysts for this reaction. Moreover, the observed photocurrent is independent of the borate buffer concentration, signaling that the buffer plays no role in the rate-determining elementary step of the reaction. Finally, we explore some recent developments in doping this material with Co (a known electrocatalytically active metal) and in coupling it with a transparent manganese phosphate (MnPO) electrocatalyst. We find that introducing Co into the wolframite structure leads to detrimental recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. However, coupling CuWO4 with MnPO increases the photocurrent density. Despite some of these challenges, CuWO4 proves to be a robust, visible light absorbing photoanode that can oxidize water with a high degree of selectivity and is therefore worthy of further exploration. Even if new compositions emerge that show better reactivity, this material serves as an excellent proving ground for the common challenges in developing ternary-phase oxides and other compositionally complex materials.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Chemically synthesized lithium peroxide composite cathodes for closed system Li-O-2 batteries","Abstract":"A binder-free lithiumperoxide-carbon nanofiber composite cathode was synthesized chemically to be used in a closed system lithium-oxygen battery without external supply of oxygen.

However, current approaches for creating electrically conductive fabrics struggle with issues ranging from low conductivity to skin irritation. The use of graphitic carbon has been investigated as a possible way to impart conductivity to fabrics, yet low loadings, required post-infusion reductions, or the need to remove additives, has limited the application of these materials. In this paper, we introduce an approach that infuses fabric with pristine few layer graphene (FLG)\/graphite from natural bulk graphite using an interfacial trapping method. No additives or chemical modification of the graphite is required, and electrical conductivities an order of magnitude higher than previous approaches are achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Interestingly, both chiral crystalline complexes appeared as regularly left- and right-twisted bundle structures about 10m in length and about 5m in diameter, whereas the dl-form occurred as circular structures with about 10m diameter. Subsequently, SiO2@cPEI\/tart hybrids with high silica content (>55.0wt%) were prepared by stirring a mixture containing tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and the aggregates of the crystalline complexes in water. The chiral SiO2 hybrids and calcined chiral SiO2 showed very strong CD signals and a nanofiber-based morphology on their surface, whereas dl-SiO2 showed no CD activity and a nanosheet-packed disklike shape. Furthermore, metallic silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were encapsulated in each silica hybrid to obtain chiral (D and L forms) and meso-like (dl form) Ag@SiO2 composites. Also, the reaction between L-cysteine (Lcys) and these Ag@SiO2 composites was preliminarily investigated. Only chiral L- and D-Ag@SiO2 composites promoted the reaction between Lcys and Ag NPs to produce a molecular [Ag-Lcys](n) complex with remarkable exciton chirality, whereas the reaction hardly occurred in the case of meso-like (dl-) Ag@SiO2 composite.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Scalable synthesis of nano-sandwich N-doped carbon materials with hierarchical-structure for energy conversion and storage","Abstract":"Increasing energy demands led us to explore cheap, sustainable and efficient materials for energy conversion and storage, but limited strategies have been established to prepare nanoscale carbon materials with tunable nanostructures.

Still, the relevance of HIs is sometimes difficult to evaluate particularly in large systems and intramolecular interactions. We put forward a method to estimate the magnitude and the different contributions of a given HI of the C...C, H-C...H, and H...H type through (i) the analysis of the electron density in the intermolecular region for eleven relative orientations of the methane dimer and (ii) the subsequent decomposition of the corresponding interaction energy in physically significant contributions using Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). Strong correlations were found between the topological properties of (r) calculated at intermolecular bond critical points and E-int(SAPT) plus its different contributions with the C<bold>C distance of the considered orientations of <\/bold>(CH4)(2). These correlations were used to construct Mollier-like diagrams of E-int(SAPT) and its components as a function of the separation between two carbons and the orientation of the groups bonded to these atoms. The ethane dimer and tert-butylcyclohexane are used as representative examples of this new approach.

Recent first-principles spin-polarized OFT calculations simulated the electrocatalytic ORR reaction process on N-doped C-60 fullerene (N-C-60) and found that O-2 can be chemisorbed and reduced on N-C-60, indicating that N-C-60 is a potential cathode catalyst for hydrogen fuel cells. In this work, a novel waste-to-resource strategy to convert fallen ginkgo leaves into this new kind of ORR electrocatalyst, nitrogen-doped fullerene-like carbon shell (NDCS), is presented. N is derived from fallen ginkgo leaves, where 10.9-15.5 wt% proteins are present. The obtained NDCS possesses 100% catalysis selectivity towards four-electron pathway, and its ORR activities outperform most of the other existing carbon-based catalysts. It also shows significantly improved tolerance against methanol and enhanced long-term stability, compared with the commercial platinum-loaded carbon catalyst. Thus it is experimentally demonstrated that the NDCS is a promising future ORR catalyst, which is well consistent with the quantum mechanics calculations. Additionally, the NDCS presents a high reversible capacity (750 mA h g(-1) at 0.02 A\/g) in Li-ion batteries. Since fallen ginkgo leaves are readily available, our study represents an exciting direction for sustainable and low-cost energy conversion and storage materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The repeatability of the photocatalytic performance of the TiO2\/SnO2 hHNFs is quite high; the decolorization capacity decrease to 80.6% of the initial value after 20 cycles.

This method leads to photo-responsive membranes with desirable properties such as light-controlled permeability changes, exceptional photo-stability and repeatability of the photo-responsive switching. Conventional track etched polyester membranes were first treated with plasma polymer coating introducing anchoring groups, which allowed the attachment of ATRP-initiator molecules on the membrane surface. Surface initiated ARGET-ATRP of hydroxyethylmethacrylate (where ARGET stands for activator regenerated by electron transfer) leads to a membrane covered with a polymer layer, whereas the controlled polymerization procedure allows good control over the thickness of the polymer layer in respect to the polymerization conditions. Therefore, the final permeability of the membranes could be tailored by choice of pore diameter of the initial membranes, applied monomer concentration or polymerization time. Moreover a remarkable switch in permeability (more than 1000%) upon irradiation with UV-light could be achieved.

Young's modulus, tensile strength, and toughness of the nylon 6 non-woven fiber mats electrospun from 20 wt % solutions increased 51%, 87%, and 136%, respectively, after incorporating 1 wt % CNTs into the nylon 6 nanofibers. Three methods were investigated to enhance fiber-fiber load sharing: increasing friction between fibers, thermal bonding, and solvent bonding. The addition of beaded nylon 6 nanofibers into the non-woven fiber mats to increase fiber-fiber friction resulted in a statistically significantly increase in Young's modulus over comparable smooth non-woven fiber mats.

Jetting and spraying applications of these materials involve progressive thinning and break-up of a fluid column or sheet into drops. Strong extensional kinematics develop in the thinning fluid neck. In viscous Newtonian fluids, inertial and viscous stresses oppose the surface tension-driven instability. In aqueous solutions of polymers such as Ethyl Hydroxy-Ethyl Cellulose (EHEC), chain elongation provides additional elastic stresses that can delay the capillary-driven pinch-off, influencing the sprayability or jettability of the complex fluid. In this study, we quantify the transient response of thinning filaments of cellulose ether solutions to extensional flows in a Capillary Break-up Extensional Rheometer (CaBER) and in a forced jet undergoing break-up using Rayleigh Ohnesorge Jetting Extensional Rheometry (ROJER). We also characterize the steady state molecular deformations using measurements of the flow-induced birefringence and excess pressure drop in an extensional stagnation point flow using a Cross-Slot Extensional Rheometer (CSER). We show that under the high extension rates encountered in jetting and spraying, the semi-dilute solutions of hydrophobically modified ethyl hydroxy-ethyl cellulose (hmEHEC) exhibit extensional thinning, while the unmodified bare chains of EHEC display an increase in extensional viscosity, up to a plateau value. For both EHEC and hmEHEC dispersions, the low extensibility of the cellulose derivatives limits the Trouton ratio observed at the highest extension rates attained (close to 105 s(-1)) to around 10-20. The reduction in extensional viscosity with increasing extension rate for the hydrophobically modified cellulose ether is primarily caused by the disruption of a transient elastic network that is initially formed by intermolecular association of hydrophobic stickers. This extensional thinning behavior, in conjunction with the low extensibility of the hydrophobically modified cellulose ether additives, makes these rheology modifiers ideal for controlling the extensional rheology in formulations that require jetting or spraying, with minimal residual stringiness or stranding.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Efficient and Selective Removal of Dyes Using Imidazolium-Based Supramolecular Gels","Abstract":"A Supramplecular gel was constructed by using an imidazolium-based surfactant, N-cetyl-N'-carboxymethyl imidazolium bromide ([N-C-16, N'-CO2H-Im]Br), in the DMSO\/H2O binary solvent mixtures and investigated as an adsorbent for retnoving dyes from aqueous solution.

The synthesized alpha-Fe2O3\/PEDOT HNPs exhibited several unique properties, including a large surface area, high conductivity, excellent electrochemical properties, and high chemical stability. In addition, the alpha-Fe2O3\/PEDOT HNPs reduced the dynamic resistance of electrolyte ions, and enabled high charge discharge rates and stable expansion of the cell voltage up to 2.0 V, thereby enabling high-performance supercapacitance. These results were attributed to synergetic effects between iron oxide (core structure with a negative working potential window) and PEDOT (shell structure with a positive working potential window), resulting in performance enhancements of specific capacitance (252.8 F g(-1)) and energy (136.3 W h kg(-1)) and power densities (10 526 W kg(-1)). The specific capacitance exhibited 92% retention after 1000 cycles. Additionally, a flexible supercapacitor based on the alpha-Fe2O3\/PEDOT HNPs was successfully demonstrated using a hydrogel electrolyte. The fabricated all-solid-state symmetrical supercapacitor produced superior electrochemical and mechanical performance, even after several bending motions.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Highly Stretchable and Sensitive Strain Sensor Based on Facilely Prepared Three-Dimensional Graphene Foam Composite","Abstract":"Wearable strain sensors with excellent stretchability and sensitivity have emerged as a very promising field which could be used for human motion detection and biomechanical systems, etc. Three-dimensional (3D) graphene foam (GF) has been reported before for high-performance strain sensors, however, some problems such as high cost preparation, low sensitivity, and stretchability still remain. In this paper, we report a highly stretchable and sensitive strain sensor based on 3D GF and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite. The GF is prepared by assembly process from graphene oxide via a facile and scalable method and possesses excellent mechanical property which facilitates the infiltration of PDMS prepolymer into the graphene framework. The as-prepared strain sensor can be stretched as high as 30% of its original length and the gauge factor of this sensor is as high as 98.66 under 5% of applied strain. Moreover, the strain sensor shows long-term stability in 200 cycles of stretching relaxing. Implementation of the device for monitoring the bending of elbow and finger results in reproducibility and various responses in the form of resistance change. Thus, the developed strain sensors exhibit great application potential in fields of biomechanical systems and human-interactive applications.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Proton transfer dynamics control the mechanism of O-2 reduction by a non-precious metal electrocatalyst","Abstract":"Many chemical and biological processes involve the transfer of both protons and electrons. The complex mechanistic details of these proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions require independent control of both electron and proton transfer. In this report, we make use of lipid-modified electrodes to modulate proton transport to a Cu-based catalyst that facilitates the O-2 reduction reaction (ORR), a PCET process important in fuel cells and O-2 reduction enzymes. By quantitatively controlling the kinetics of proton transport to the catalyst, we demonstrate that undesired side products such as H2O2 and O-2(-) arise from a mismatch between proton and electron transfer rates. Whereas fast proton kinetics induce H2O2 formation and sluggish proton flux produces O-2(-), proton transfer rates commensurate with O-O bond breaking rates ensure that only the desired H2O product forms. This fundamental insight aids in the development of a comprehensive framework for understanding the ORR and PCET processes in general.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"The Effect of Phenol Composition on the Sensory Profile of Smoke Affected Wines","Abstract":"Vineyards exposed to wildfire generated smoke can produce wines with elevated levels of lignin derived phenols that have acrid, metallic and smoky aromas and flavour attributes. While a large number of phenols are present in smoke affected wines, the effect of smoke vegetation source on the sensory descriptors has not been reported. Here we report on a descriptive sensory analysis of wines made from grapes exposed to different vegetation sources of smoke to examine: (1) the effect vegetation source has on wine sensory attribute ratings and; (2) associations between volatile and glycoconjugated phenol composition and sensory attributes. Sensory attribute ratings were determined by a trained sensory panel and phenol concentrations determined by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Analysis of variance, principal component analysis and partial least squares regressions were used to evaluate the interrelationships between the phenol composition and sensory attributes. The results showed that vegetation source of smoke significantly affected sensory attribute intensity, especially the taste descriptors. Differences in aroma and taste from smoke exposure were not limited to an elevation in a range of detractive descriptors but also a masking of positive fruit descriptors. Sensory differences due to vegetation type were driven by phenol composition and concentration. In particular, the glycoconjugates of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (vanillin), 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)ethanone (acetovanillone), 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (syringaldehyde) and 1-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanone (acetosyringone) concentrations were influential in separating the vegetation sources of smoke. It is concluded that the detractive aroma attributes of smoke affected wine, especially of smoke and ash, were associated with volatile phenols while the detractive flavour descriptors were correlated with glycoconjugated phenols.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Porous carbonized graphene-embedded fungus film as an interlayer for superior Li-S batteries","Abstract":"Graphene-embedded carbon fiber (GFC) film has been fabricated by using filamentous fungus (Aspergillus niger) as carbonizable fibers to drive the graphene nanosheets to embed in the hyphae network system and then carbonizing at 700 degrees C.

The large cations of ILs are, however, difficult to diffuse into solid electrodes, making them unappealing for application in some electrochemical devices. To address this issue, a new strategy is used to introduce proton conduction into an IL-based electrolyte. Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (P(VDF-HFP)) copolymer is functionalized with sulfonic acid through covalent attachment of taurine. The sulfonic acid-grafted P(VDF-HFP) electrospun mats consist of interconnected nanofibers, leading to remarkable improvement in dimensional stability of the mats. IL-based polymer electrolytes are prepared by immersing the modified mats in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIM+BF4-). It is found that the SO3- groups can have Lewis acid-base interactions with the cations (BMIM+) of IL to promote the dissociation of ILs, and provide additional proton conduction, resulting in significantly improved ionic conductivity. Using this novel electrolyte, polyaniline-based electrochromic devices show higher transmittance contrast and faster switching behavior. Furthermore, the sulfonic acid-grafted P(VDF-HFP) electrospun mats can also be lithiated, giving additional lithium ion conduction for the IL-based electrolyte, with which Li\/LiCoO2 batteries display enhanced C-rate performance.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Preparation of Graphene Oxide-Based Hydrogels as Efficient Dye Adsorbents for Wastewater Treatment","Abstract":"Graphene oxide (GO) sheets exhibit superior adsorption capacity for removing organic dye pollutants from an aqueous environment.

For both methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB), the as-prepared hydrogels exhibit removal rates within about 4 h in accordance with the pseudo-second-order model. The dye adsorption capacity of the hydrogel is mainly attributed to the GO sheets, whereas the PEI was incorporated to facilitate the gelation process of GO sheets.

Here, we prepared a novel electrospun blend from poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), a non-conductive and biodegradable polymer, and a conductive polymer, namely polypyrrole (PPy). Therefore, the goal was to create electrically conductive nanoscaffolds for tissue engineering applications. Furthermore, to improve the scaffold biomimetic features for bone regeneration purposes, we demonstrated the feasibility of electrodepositing nanohydroxyapatite (nHAp) onto the new hybrid scaffold. Electrochemical measurements confirmed the electrical conductivity of the novel PBAT\/PPy scaffold, which allowed nHAp electrodeposition, further confirmed via ATR-FTIR analysis and FE-SEM micrographs. The PPy loading did not change the fibers' average diameter, although the increase in the solution conductivity was probably responsible for leading to electrospun mats with smaller beads and a lower presence of flattened regions compared to PBAT neat. The hybrid scaffold was more hydrophilic than PBAT neat. The first presented an advanced contact angle (ACA) of 84 degrees, whilst the latter presented an ACA of 115 degrees. The incorporation of PPy to PBAT maintained the ability of the generated scaffold to support cell adhesion with no changes in MG-63 cell viability. However, the PBAT\/PPy scaffold presented higher values of alkaline phosphatase, an important indicator of osteoblasts differentiation. In conclusion, we demonstrated a feasible approach to create electrically conductive nanoscaffolds, which are capable of undergoing nHAp electrodeposition in order to generate materials that are more hydrophilic with improved cell differentiation. These results show the potential of application of this novel scaffold towards bone regenerative medicine.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Accumulative Charge Separation for Solar Fuels Production: Coupling Light-Induced Single Electron Transfer to Multielectron Catalysis","Abstract":"CONSPECTUS: The conversion and storage of solar energy into a fuel holds promise to provide a significant part of the future renewable energy demand of our societies. Solar energy technologies today generate heat or electricity, while the large majority of our energy is used in the form of fuels. Direct conversion of solar energy to a fuel would satisfy our needs for storable energy on a large scale. Solar fuels can be generated by absorbing light and converting its energy to chemical energy by electron transfer leading to separation of electrons and holes. The electrons are used in the catalytic reduction of a cheap substrate with low energy content into a high-energy fuel. The holes are filled by oxidation of water, which is the only electron source available for large scale solar fuel production. Absorption of a single photon typically leads to separation of a single electron hole pair. In contrast, fuel production and water oxidation are multielectron, multiproton reactions. Therefore, a system for direct solar fuel production must be able to accumulate the electrons and holes provided by the sequential absorption of several photons in order to complete the catalytic reactions. In this Account, the process is termed accumulative charge separation. This is considerably more complicated than charge separation on a single electron level and needs particular attention. Semiconductor materials and molecular dyes have for a long time been optimized for use in photovoltaic devices. Efforts are made to develop new systems for light harvesting and charge separation that are better optimized for solar fuel production than those used in the early devices presented so far. Significant progress has recently been made in the discovery and design of better homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for solar fuels and water oxidation. While the heterogeneous ones perform better today, molecular catalysts based on transition metal complexes offer much greater tunability of electronic and structural properties, they are typically more amenable to mechanistic analysis, and they are small and therefore require less material. Therefore, they have arguably greater potential as future efficient catalysts but must be efficiently coupled to accumulative charge separation. This Account discusses accumulative charge separation with focus on molecular and molecule semiconductor hybrid systems. The coupling between charge separation and catalysis involves many challenges that are often overlooked, and they are not always apparent when studying water oxidation and fuel formation as separate half-reactions with sacrificial agents. Transition metal catalysts, as well as other multielectron donors and acceptors, cycle through many different states that may quench the excited sensitizer by nonproductive pathways. Examples where this has been shown, often with ultrafast rates, are reviewed. Strategies to avoid these competing energy-loss reactions and still obtain efficient coupling of charge separation to catalysis are discussed. This includes recent examples of dye-sensitized semiconductor devices with molecular catalysts and dyes that realize complete water splitting, albeit with limited efficiency.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Stannous ions reducing graphene oxide at room temperature to produce SnOx-porous, carbon-nanofiber flexible mats as binder-free anodes for lithium-ion batteries","Abstract":"Tin oxides with high theoretical capacities as anodes for lithium-ion batteries always suffer from the electrical disconnect issue of active materials owing to huge volume changes.

Results showed that DGP and CSAD exhibit competitive adsorption behaviour at the water-gas interface and that this competitive behaviour can be intensified by NaCl. EPR revealed that the cholesterol groups of CSAD participate in the formation of micellar structures. The steric effect of the cholesterol groups reduces the microviscosity of the micellar structure, but high-concentration NaCl can weaken the polarity and increase the microviscosity of the formed micellar structure. In addition, at a high DGP concentration, high-concentration NaCl can facilitate DGP precipitation; this condition causes abnormal phenomena of surface tension, fluorescence spectroscopy, and EPR. For the emulsion system, analysis of particle size and rheology indicated that DGP and CSAD form a network structure between oil and water interfaces through interaction and thus enhance the non-Newtonian fluid properties of the emulsion. Owing to the competitive adsorption between CSAD and DGP at the oil-water interface, DGP gradually replaces CSAD with the increase in DGP concentration. With a further increase in DGP concentration, the stable steric effect of polymers between oil drops may disappear, and oil drops may aggregate mutually.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Multifunctional electroactive electrospun nanofiber structures from water solution blends of PVA\/ODA-MMT and poly(maleic acid-alt-acrylic acid): effects of Ag, organoclay, structural rearrangement and NaOH doping factors","Abstract":"Novel multifunctional colloidal polymer nanofiber electrolytes were fabricated by green reactive electrospinning nanotechnology from various water solution\/dispersed blends of poly (vinyl alcohol-co-vinyl acetate) (PVA)\/octadecyl amine-montmorillonite (ODA-MMT) as matrix polymer nanocomposite and poly(maleic acid-alt-acrylic acid) (poly(MAc-alt-AA) and\/or its Ag-carrying complex as partner copolymers.

The fabricated organic\/inorganic hybrid ATT-doped PLGA nanofibers may find many applications in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Breathability Enhancement of Electrospun Microfibrous Polyurethane Membranes through Pore Size Control for Outdoor Sportswear Fabric","Abstract":"Electrospinning of polyurethane (PU) is widely used to fabricate breathable fabrics for applications in outdoor sportswear, and can be used to produce a highly porous structure, which is an essential property of a breathable fabric. To increase the breathability of the fabric, herein we describe the use of a metal mesh as the ground electrode in place of the conventional planar electrode during electrospinning. This electrode geometry results in an electric field that leads to the electrospun fibers being predominantly stacked over the metal wires of the mesh, with fewer fibers over the holes, resulting in larger pores in the membrane. The average pore size and thickness of the membrane were compared with those of a membrane fabricated using a conventional planar electrode. A quantitative analysis performed according to the Korean Industrial Standards (KS) indicated improved breathability.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"A vertical and cross-linked Ni(OH)(2) network on cellulose-fiber covered with graphene as a binder-free electrode for advanced asymmetric supercapacitors","Abstract":"Nanostructured transition metal oxides are attractive pseudocapacitive materials with high theoretical specific capacitance, scale-up potential and environmental benignity.

Herein, a three-dimensional carbon support of cellulose-fiber covered with graphene (CFG) to induce the growth of a hierarchical nanostructured Ni(OH)(2) (Ni(OH)(2)-CFG) is fabricated through a one-pot hydrothermal reaction without using any surfactants or hard templates. The resulting Ni(OH)(2)-CFG composite exhibits a special vertical and cross-linked network structure with a large surface area (425.9 m(2) g(-1), higher than that of unsupported Ni(OH)(2), 366.9 m(2) g(-1)) and appropriate pore size distribution of micro-mesopores, which offer fast electrolyte ion-transport and short ion-diffusion pathways. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the Ni(OH)(2)-CFG composite as a binder-free electrode reveals high mass capacitance (2276 F g(-1), at 1 A g(-1)), good rate capability and excellent cycling stability (no capacitance decay after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g(-1)).

Significantly, it possesses extremely high stabilities of both electrochemical surface area and ORR compared to the commercial Pt\/C catalyst even after 10 000 potential cycles.

The results show that the M\/AC could effectively improve desulphurization performance, and the highest sulphur capacity was obtained at 143 mg g(-1) for the Ni\/AC sample with a blending ratio of 12 wt%, which was higher than that of the blank sample (97 mg g(-1)).

A goal of this work is to gain a fundamental understanding of the interplay between water molecules, the sodium cation and a diazacrown. Diazacrowns have a significant importance as the functional units of a synthetic sodium channel, called a hydraphile, which functions within a lipid bilayer. This study follows on from our previous classical molecular dynamics study, which investigated the free energy of transport of Na+ as it passes through a lipid bilayer. In the present study we focus on the complexation of Na+, the conformation of the diazacrown and electronic structure that cannot be accessed by classical force fields. Furthermore, we benchmark the force field used in the previous study and make a modification of the dihedral parameters to improve its description. A whole range of configurations are scanned to gain an understanding of the energy landscape and find the minimum energies for configurations involving the diazacrown, diazacrown-Na+, diazacrown-water and diazacrown-Na+-water configurations. Our results show that there is an attractive interaction between Na+ and the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the diazacrown for which the interaction between Na+ and the oxygen atoms are the stronger of the two. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis shows charge-transfer between the diazacrown and Na+ resulting in a reduced positive charge for this cation. This charge transfer occurs directly and via a water-mediated mechanism and could be crucial to the action of the hydraphile sodium channel. Since, in our previous classical molecular dynamics work, it was shown that water molecules accompany Na+ cations as they are transported through a lipid bilayer, while the cations are complexed to the diazacrown moiety of the hydraphile, we aim to better understand the structural, electronic structural and energetic implications of this complexation. Calculations of a water molecule interacting with the diazacrown show that the strongest interaction involves a bridging water molecule that forms hydrogen bonds with two diazacrown oxygen atoms or an oxygen and nitrogen atom on opposite sides of the diazacrown. These interactions may be important in the ordering of water to form a water channel that allows the Na+ to pass through the lipid bilayer.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Nanocarbons from rice husk by microwave plasma irradiation: From graphene and carbon nanotubes to graphenated carbon nanotube hybrids","Abstract":"Recently, graphene and carbon nanotube (CNT) composites have attracted great interest of scientists and exhibited fascinating properties even better than they could on their own.

The RH-derived g-CNTs were composed of graphene standing on the sidewalls of CNTs, in which the graphene sheets possessed a large amount of sharp edges, which mainly consisted of 2-6 layers, and the CNTs had several tens of micrometers in length and 50-200 in diameter.

Carbon-free cathodes thus become critical for Li-O-2 batteries, but generally exhibit low capacity and poor rate because of their high density and insufficient pore characteristic. Herein, we present a simple method to prepare a core-shell-structured TiO2(B) nanofiber@porous RuO2 composite, which is used as a carbon-free catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. The RuO2 coating layer replicates the structure of TiO2 nanofibers to form a one-dimensional RuO2 shell with a typical hierarchical mesoporous\/macroporous structure. Besides the reduced undesired decomposition, the abundant porous structure and inherent high conductivity of the RuO2 coating layer also increase the specific capacity, efficiency, rate ability and cycle life. With a high mass loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2) on the cathode, the Li-O-2 battery shows a performance superior to previous reports, including high capacity (800 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.125 mA cm(-2) or 50 mA g(-1)) with a very high energy efficiency of >82.5%, good rate (500 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 mA cm(-2) or 200 mA g(-1)) and long-life (80 cycles at a fixed capacity of 300 mA h g(-1)).

A gel is treated as a three-phase medium consisting of a solid phase (polymer network), solvent (water), and solute (mobile ions). Transport of solvent and solute is thought of as their diffusion through the polymer network accelerated by an electric field formed by mobile and fixed ions and accompanied by chemical reactions (dissociation of functional groups attached to polymer chains and formation of ion pairs between bound charges and mobile counter-ions). Constitutive equations are derived by means of the free energy imbalance inequality for an arbitrary three-dimensional deformation with finite strains. These relations are applied to analyze equilibrium swelling diagrams on poly(acrylic acid) gel, poly(methacrylic acid) gel, and three composite hydrogels under water uptake in a bath (i) with a fixed molar fraction of salt and varied pH, and (ii) with a fixed pH and varied molar fraction of salt.

Bioethanol is a biofuel that can be obtained from biomass and waste as feedstocks through fermentation. Two major routes allow conversion of the feedstocks to fermentable substrates, i.e. the hydrolytic route and the thermochemical route. In the hydrolytic route, the feedstock undergoes a pretreatment stage first, aimed at facilitating the subsequent hydrolytic treatment. Chemical, physical or biological pretreatments can be applied. Lignocellulosic feedstocks are mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The pretreatment attacks the lignin and hemicellulose polymers and makes cellulose more accessible in the next, hydrolytic, stage. The hydrolytic treatment uses enzymes to convert the cellulose polymer to simple, fermentable, sugars, mainly glucose. Simple sugars obtained from hemicellulose and cellulose are then fermented by yeasts to bioethanol. In the thermochemical alternative, the feedstock is gasified, yielding syngas-a mixture largely composed of CO, CO2 and H-2-which can be fermented anaerobically, usually by clostridia, to ethanol or other products. In both cases, downstream processes are then applied to recover and purify the biofuel. The different stages involved in both alternatives are described, and both processes are compared in terms of their main characteristics and development stage.

The potential-induced SEIRA difference spectroscopy discloses that cyt c was loosely adsorbed onto CL_PC\/DT\/Au in a different orientation and underwent a new beta-sheet formation relative to native cyt c adsorbed onto MUA\/Au.

When block copolymers self-assemble, the result is polymersomes with tailored structural properties and built-in releasing mechanisms, controlled by stimuli-responsive polymer building blocks. More recently, chemists are becoming interested in multifunctional hybrid vesicles containing inorganic nanocrystals with unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties. In this Account, We review our recent progress in assembling amphiphilic plasmonic nanostructures to create a new class of multifunctional hybrid vesicles and applying them towards cancer diagnosis and therapy. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) gives plasmonic nanomaterials a unique set of optical properties that are potentially useful for both biosensing and nanomedicine. For instance, the strong light scattering at their LSPR wavelength opens up the applications of plasmonic nanostructures in single particle plasmonic imaging. Their superior photothermal conversion properties, on the other hand, make them excellent transducers for photothermal ablation and contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging. Of particular note for ultrasensitive detection is that the confined electromagnetic field resulting from excitation of LSPR can give rise to highly efficient surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for molecules in close proximity. We have explored several ways to combine well-defined plasmonic nanocrystals with amphiphilic polymer brushes of diverse chemical functionalities. In multiple systems, we have shown that the polymer grafts impart amphiphilicity-driven self-assembly to the hybrid nanoparticles. This has allowed us to synthesize well-defined vesicles in which we have embedded plasmonic nanocrystals in the shell of collapsed hydrophobic polymers. The hydrophilic brushes extend into external and interior aqueous environment to stabilize the vesicular structure. More importantly, we have demonstrated that strong interparticle coupling greatly enhances the optical properties (scattering, photothermal conversion, and SERS) in plasmonic vesicles. In combination with the loading capacity of the vesicles, this technology can provide unique opportunities for integrated diagnosis and therapy, multimodality combination therapy, and imaging-guided therapy. One key property differentiating the plasmonic vesicles from other vesicular structures containing nanocrystals is that we can tailor the interparticle coupling and disintegration of the plasmonic vesicles by altering structural parameters and conformational changes of the covalently bound polymer-brushes. This gives us tremendous flexibility to engineer plasmonic vesicles for ultrasensitive detection and targeted therapy. Through bringing together advances in nanochemistry, polymer chemistry, self-assembly, and nanophotonics, we expect to further expand our capability of tailoring optical and structural characteristics of plasmonic vesicles to address challenges in medical settings.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Magnetoelastically induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and perpendicular exchange bias of CoO\/CoPt multilayer films","Abstract":"The effects of magnetoelastically induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) on perpendicular exchange bias (PEB) have been studied in [CoO5nm\/CoPt5nm](5) multilayer films.

In-plane tensile stress of CoPt layer was calculated by sin(2)phi method, and we found it increased gradually upon annealing from 0.99 GPa (as-deposited) up to 3.02 GPa (300 degrees C-annealed). As to the magnetic property, significant enhancement of PMA was achieved in [CoO5nm\/CoPt5nm](5) multilayer films after annealing due to the increase of CoPt layer in-plane tensile stress. With the enhancement of magnetoelastically induced PMA, great improvement of PEB was also achieved in [CoO5nrn\/CoPt5nm](5) multilayer films, which increased from 130 Oe (as-deposited) up to 1060 Oe (300 degrees C-annealed), showing the same change tendency as PMA and the strong correlation with CoPt layer in-plane tensile stress. We consider it is the increase of CoPt layer in-plane tensile stress that leads to the enhancement of CoPt layer PMA, which is favorable for the spins in CoPt layer aligning to a more perpendicular direction. And thus the enhanced PMA with more perpendicular spins alignment in CoPt layer results in the improved PEB in [CoO5nrn\/CoPt5nm](5) multilayer films through enhanced perpendicular spins coupling at CoO\/CoPt interfaces.

In the presence of co-reactant K2S2O8, the ECL emission of Pb-beta-CD was enhanced by the formation of Au nanoparticles, which is desirable for the construction of a RET immunosensor. The absorption spectra great overlaps with the ECL spectra of Pb-beta-CD. This enabled the ECL-RET by incorporating Au@Pb-beta-CD and CRuSi NPs into electrode surfaces. The immunosensor is fabricated using Au@Pb-beta-CD as sensing platform and CRuSi NPs as labels of antibodies. After the optimization of determination conditions, a linear response range for insulin from 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 10.0 ng mL(-1) was obtained, and the limit of detection was calculated to be 0.042 pg mL(-1) (S\/N = 3). The prepared insulin biosensor displayed excellent stability and good specificity.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Flexible lateral organic solar cells with core-shell structured organic nanofibers","Abstract":"One-dimensional conjugated polymer fibers provide unperturbed percolation pathways for efficient charge transport. Here, we report the fabrication of photoresponsive core-shell organic semiconductor fibers by using co-axial electrospinning and their application to the flexible organic photovoltaic devices. The electrospun organic semiconductor fibers are encapsulated with a sheath, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and consist of the photoactive materials poly(3-hexylthiophene) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM).

Most of these sustainable biorefinery products can be produced from plant polysaccharides (glucans, hemicelluloses, starch, and pectic materials) and lignin. In this scenario, cellulosic ethanol has been considered for decades as one of the most promising alternatives to mitigate fossil fuel dependence and carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere. However, a pretreatment method is required to overcome the physical and chemical barriers that exist in the lignin-carbohydrate composite and to render most, if not all, of the plant cell wall components easily available for conversion into valuable products, including the fuel ethanol. Hence, pretreatment is a key step for an economically viable biorefinery. Successful pretreatment method must lead to partial or total separation of the lignocellulosic components, increasing the accessibility of holocellulose to enzymatic hydrolysis with the least inhibitory compounds being released for subsequent steps of enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. Each pretreatment technology has a different specificity against both carbohydrates and lignin and may or may not be efficient for different types of biomasses. Furthermore, it is also desirable to develop pretreatment methods with chemicals that are greener and effluent streams that have a lower impact on the environment. This paper provides an overview of the most important pretreatment methods available, including those that are based on the use of green solvents (supercritical fluids and ionic liquids).","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Visible-Light-Induced Photoredox Catalysis of Dye-Sensitized Titanium Dioxide: Selective Aerobic Oxidation of Organic Sulfides","Abstract":"TiO2 photoredox catalysis has recently attracted much interest for use in performing challenging organic transformations under mild reaction conditions. However, the reaction scheme is hampered by the fact that TiO2 can only be excited by UV light of wavelengths shorter than 385nm. One promising strategy to overcome this issue is to anchor an organic, preferably metal-free dye onto the surface of TiO2. Importantly, we observed that the introduction of a catalytic amount of the redox mediator TEMPO [(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl] ensured the stability of the anchored dye, alizarin redS, thereby resulting in the selective oxidation of organic sulfides with O-2. This result affirms the essential role of the redox mediator in enabling the organic transformations by visible-light photoredox catalysis.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Strong Fluorescent Smart Organogel as a Dual Sensing Material for Volatile Acid and Organic Amine Vapors","Abstract":"An L-phenylalanine derivative (C12PhBPCP) consisting of a strong emission fluorophore with benzoxazole and cyano groups is designed and synthesized to realize dual responses to volatile acid and organic amine vapors. The photophysical properties and self-assembly of the said derivative in the gel phase are also studied. C12PhBPCP can gelate organic solvents and self assemble into 1D nanofibers in the gels. UVNis absorption spectral results show H-aggregate formation during gelation, which indicates strong exciton coupling between fluorophores. Both wet gel and xero- gel emit strong green fluorescence because the cyano group suppresses fluorescence quenching in the self-assemblies. Moreover, the xerogel film with strong green fluorescence can be used as a dual chemosensor for quantitative detection of volatile acid and organic amine vapors with fast response times and low detection limits owing to its large surface area and amplified fluorescence quenching.

In this work, the biological effect of the Ag\/AgBr\/TiO2\/Active carbon (AC) composites was studied on the plasmid DNA and Tetrahymena membrane. The atomic force micrograph (AFM) images showed that, in the presence of the composites under illumination, most pUC18 DNA molecules showed quite different topography and were opened and relaxed circle shapes. After DNA was catalyzed for 40 min, all supercoiled and circular DNA were changed into the linear DNA molecules. The gel electrophoresis experiment confirmed the results and demonstrated the dynamic process of DNA degradation.

Regarding the synthesis process, the matrix and the particle content are analysed. The analysed matrixes are a natural rubber, a silicone rubber and ELASTOSIL((R)) silicone, and three particle contents are synthesised. The influence of the characterisation variables on the linear viscoelastic limit, that is, frequency, external magnetic field and temperature, is also analysed. Strain sweep tests are used to determine the dynamic complex modulus. The loss factor and the storage modulus are analysed to define the linear viscoelastic limit of each isotropic magnetorheological elastomer sample in all the working conditions. The results show that the linear viscoelastic region of the magnetorheological elastomers is defined by the loss factor. Moreover, the volumetric particle content reduces and frequency increases the linear viscoelastic region of all the matrixes, whereas the external magnetic field and the temperature influences are matrix dependent.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"A New Interleukin-13 Amino-Coated Gadolinium Metallofullerene Nanoparticle for Targeted MRI Detection of Glioblastoma Tumor Cells","Abstract":"The development of new nanoparticles as next-generation diagnostic and therapeutic (theranostic) drug platforms is an active area of both chemistry and cancer research. Although numerous gadolinium (Gd) containing metallofullerenes as diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents have been reported, the metallofullerene cage surface, in most cases, consists of negatively charged carboxyl or hydroxyl groups that limit attractive forces with the cellular surface. It has been reported that nanoparticles with a positive charge will bind more efficiently to negatively charged phospholipid bilayer cellular surfaces, and will more readily undergo endocytosis. In this paper, we report the preparation of a new functionalized trimetallic nitride template endohedral metallofullerene (TNT EMF), Gd3N@C-80(OH)(x)(NH2)(y), with a cage surface bearing positively charged amino groups (-NH3+) and directly compare it with a similar carboxyl and hydroxyl functionalized derivative.

Tensile Testing and Recovery of Mechanical Properties","Abstract":"The present work aims at development of self-healing materials capable of partially restoring their mechanical properties under the conditions of prolonged periodic loading and unloading, which is characteristic, for example, of aerospace applications. Composite materials used in these and many other applications frequently reveal multiple defects stemming from their original inhomogeneity, which facilitates microcracking and delamination at ply interfaces. Self-healing nanofiber mats may effectively prevent such damage without compromising material integrity. Two types of core shell nanofibers were simultaneously electrospun onto the same substrate in order to form a mutually entangled mat. The first type of core shell fibers consisted of resin monomer (dimethylsiloxane) within the core and polyacrylonitrile within the shell. The second type of core shell nanofibers consisted of cure (dimethyl-methyl hydrogen-siloxane) within the core and polyacrylonitrile within the shell. These mutually entangled nanofiber mats were used for tensile testing, and they were also encased in polydimethylsiloxane to form composites that were also subsequently subjected to tensile testing. During tensile tests, the nanofibers can be damaged in stretching up to the plastic regime of deformation. Then, the resin monomer and cure was released from the cores and the polydimethylsiloxane resin was polymerized, which might be expected to result in the self-healing properties of these materials. To reveal and evaluate the self-healing properties of the polyacrylonitrile-resin-cure nanofiber mats and their composites, the results were compared to the tensile test results of the monolithic polyacrylonitrile nanofiber mats or composites formed by encasing polyacrylonitrile nanofibers in a polydimethylsiloxane matrix. The latter do not possess self-healing properties, and indeed, do not recover their mechanical characteristics, in contrast to the polyacrylonitrile-resin-cure nanofiber mats and the composites reinforced by such mats. This is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, where self-healing nanofibers and composites based on them were developed, tested, and revealed restoration of mechanical properties (stiffness) in a 24 h rest period at room temperature.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Peptides as skin penetration enhancers: Mechanisms of action","Abstract":"Skin penetrating peptides (SPPs) have garnered wide attention in recent years and emerged as a simple and effective noninvasive strategy for macromolecule delivery into the skin. Although SPPs have demonstrated their potential in enhancing skin delivery, they are still evolving as a new class of skin penetration enhancers. Detailed studies elucidating their mechanisms of action are still lacking. Using five SPPs (SPACE peptide, TD-1, polyarginine, a dermis-localizing peptide and a skin penetrating linear peptide) and a model hydrophobic macromolecule (Cyclosporine A, CsA), herein we provide a mechanistic understanding of SPPs. To evaluate the mechanism and safety of SPPs, their effects on skin lipids, proteins and keratinocyte cells were evaluated. Three SPPs (SPACE, Polyarginine and TD-1) significantly enhanced CsA penetration into the skin. SPPs did not alter the skin lipid barrier as measured by skin resistance, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis. In contrast, SPPs interacted with skin proteins and induced changes in skin protein secondary structures (alpha-helices, beta-sheet, random coils and turns), as evaluated by FTIR analysis and confirmed by in-silico docking. SPPs enhanced CsA skin penetration, via a transcellular pathway, enhancing its partitioning into keratin-rich corneocytes through concurrent binding of SPP with keratin and CsA. Interaction between SPP and keratin best correlated with measured CsA skin transport. Many SPPs appeared to be safe as shown by negligible effect on skin integrity, nominal skin irritation potential and cytotoxicity. Among the peptides tested, SPACE peptide was found to be least toxic to keratinocytes, and among the most effective at delivering CsA into the skin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These spectral changes were observed even at minute amounts of the acceptor (starting at 1 mol%), suggesting that exciton migration is involved in energy transport and supporting a funnel-like energy transduction mechanism.

By adjusting the concentration of acrylic acid (AAc) in the NIPAM-based hydrogel phantoms, the cloud point (i.e., lower critical solution temperature) of the phantoms could be tailored to produce HIFU thermal lesions similar to those formed in different swine tissues in terms of size and shape. Additionally, energy thresholds for inducing transient or permanent bubbles in the phantoms during HIFU ablation were also identified to shed light on the onset of cavitation or material damage.

Being a high molecular weight (MW) polyanion, siRNA is not able to cross a cell membrane, and in addition it is unstable in physiological conditions. Accordingly, a biocompatible nanocarrier able to deliver siRNA into cells is needed. In this work, we synthesized biocompatible positively charged nanoparticles (NPs) following a two-step process that involves ring opening polymerization (ROP) and emulsion free radical polymerization (EFRP). Firstly, we proved the possibility of fine tuning the NPs' characteristics (e.g. size and surface charge) by changing the synthetic process parameters. Then the capability in loading and delivering undamaged siRNA into a cancer cell cytoplasm has been shown. This latter process occurs through the biodegradation of the polymer constituting the NPs, whose kinetics can be tuned by adjusting the polymer's MW.

These methods are based on reversible, covalent interactions that have been exploited extensively in hostguest chemistry, but were comparatively underutilized in catalysis. Important differences between the established properties of organboron compounds in molecular recognition and their behavior as catalysts emerged over the course of this work: for instance, borinic acids, which have largely been ignored in molecular recognition, proved to be a particularly useful class of catalysts. Nonetheless, the high selectivity that has enabled applications of organoboron compounds in molecular recognition (e.g., the selective binding of cis-1,2-diol groups in carbohydrates) also appears to play a key role in the outcomes of catalytic reactions. This research program began as a modest, narrowly defined project aimed at developing direct aldol reactions based on established interactions between pyruvic acids and boronic acids. While this goal was achieved, it was unexpected observations related to the nature of the nucleophile in this transformation (a putative tetracoordinate boron enolate) that attracted our attention and pointed toward broader applications in the catalyst-controlled, regioselective functionalization of polyols. This line of research proved to be fruitful: diarylborinic-acid-based precatalysts were found to promote efficient monoalkylations, sulfonylations, and alkylations of a range of diol substrates, as well as cis-1,2-diol motifs in pyranoside-derived triols. Extension of this chemistry to glycosyl donors as electrophiles enabled the regioselective, catalyst-controlled synthesis of disaccharides from readily accessible feedstocks, and was also employed to modify the oligosaccharide component of a complex, glycosylated natural product. Mechanistic studies have played an important role in our efforts to optimize catalyst activity and expand substrate scope for this class of transformations. For instance, it was kinetic studies of the sulfonylation of diols that motivated us to investigate heteroboraanthracene-derived borinic acids as catalysts, despite their low affinity for these substrates. Likewise, preliminary studies suggesting an S(N)2-type pathway for organoboron-catalyzed glycosylations were instrumental in our development of a method for selective formation of beta-2-deoxyglycosides. Details of these mechanistic studies, along with prospects for applying catalyst-controlled glycosylation in oligosaccharide synthesis and natural product glycorandomization, are discussed.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Tunnelling conductive hybrid films of gold nanoparticles and cellulose and their applications as electrochemical electrodes","Abstract":"Conductive hybrid films of metal nanoparticles and polymers have practical applications in the fields of sensing, microelectronics and catalysis, etc. Herein, we present the electrochemical availability of tunnelling conductive hybrid films of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and cellulose.

Nanofibers of the polyelectrolyte precursor, brominated poly(phenylene oxide) with 0.95 CH2Br groups per mer, and PPSU were simultaneously electrospun onto a common collector and the resulting dual fiber mat was converted into a dense and defect-free anion exchange membrane by sequential soaking in a diamine crosslinker solution, exposure to chloroform vapor, and immersion in a solution of either trimethylamine or 1,2-dimethylimidazole.

The method is developed for the sulfoxide and trichloroacetimidate glycosylation protocols. The method reveals that O-glycosylation reactions have stronger concentration dependencies than C-glycosylation reactions consistent with a more associative, S(N)2-like character. For the 4,6-O-benzylidene-directed mannosylation reaction a significant difference in concentration dependence is found for the formation of the beta- and alpha-anomers, suggesting a difference in mechanism and a rationale for the optimization of selectivity regardless of the type of donor employed.

The plasma was generated in 200 mL of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), which was applied as the carbon and nitrogen precursors. The NCNS presented an electrical resistivity of 0.065 Omega cm, which is comparable with that of N-doped carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs).

The addition of stable aqueous suspension of thermally reduced graphite oxide (TRGO) stabilized by ionic surfactants to NR latex can favor the occurrence of interaction between the stabilized TRGO and NR particles. Herein, the use of two surfactants of different nature, namely, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB), for the preparation of (TRGO)\/NR nanocomposites, is reported. Zeta potential and particle size measurements indicated that the use of DTAB as cationic surfactant results in the flocculation of NR particles and promoted the formation of ion-pair interactions between TRGO and the proteins and\/or phospholipids present on the NR surface. This indicates that the use of DTAB can promote a self-assembly phenomenon between TRGO with adsorbed DTAB molecules and NR particles. The occurrence of self-assembly phenomenon allows obtaining homogenous dispersion of TRGO particles in the polymer matrix. The TRGO\/NR nanocomposites prepared by the use of DTAB exhibited superior mechanical properties and excellent electrical conductivities reaching values of stress at 500% strain of 3.02 MPa and 10(-4) S\/cm, respectively.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"A low-cost and one-step synthesis of N-doped monolithic quasi-graphene films with porous carbon frameworks for Li-ion batteries","Abstract":"We report the fabrication of monolithic quasi-graphene film with porous carbon frameworks (GPF), both nitrogen-doped, by a one-step pyrolysis of commercial filter membrane, and demonstrate its improved performance in Li-ion storage compared to commercial graphite. Several advantageous features (porous framework and its integrity with the quasi-graphene, N doping) of this new electrode are manifested by its high-rate and long-cycling rechargeable Li-ion storage. A high reversible capacity of 493 mA h g(-1) is achieved at a rate of 0.1 degrees C. And at a fast charge\/discharge rate of 30 degrees C, the GPF electrode delivers a capacity of 220 mA h g(-1), which can last for up to 5000 cycles with nearly no capacity fading. We also demonstrate the GPF as a new type of current collector for active materials with improved mass loading and rate performance. The fabrication is cost effective, highly efficient, and scalable, and thus may pave way to new carbonaceous materials for high-performance energy storage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The deposition of double nozzle NFES has been studied with Coulomb's law and theoretical derivation has been verified by the experimental conclusion.

Glycosidic linkages (alpha and beta) and side chains (-COOH and -OH) were selected and proven as the major factors of the molecular structures. Three different single component polysaccharides were compared: pectin for a linkages versus carboxylic methyl cellulose (CMC) for beta-linkages from the linkage's standpoint, and pectin as a COOH-containing polymer and amylose as its non-COOH counterpart from the side chain's standpoint. Pectin was remarkably superior to CMC and amylose in cyclability and rate capability of battery cells based on silicon anodes. The pectin binder allowed volume expansion of silicon electrodes with keeping high porosity during lithiation due to the elastic nature the chair-to-boat conformation in a-linkages of its backbone. Physical integrity of pectin-based electrodes was not challenged during repeated lithiation\/delithiation cycles without crack development that was observed in rigid CMC-based electrodes. Covalent bonds formed between carboxylic side chains of pectin and silicon surface oxide prevented active silicon mass from being detached away from electric pathways. However, hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl side chains of amylose and silicon surface oxide were not strong enough to keep the silicon mass electrochemically active after cyclability tests.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Biomass derived palygorskite-carbon nanocomposites: Synthesis, characterisation and affinity to dye compounds","Abstract":"Clay minerals can act as a uniform dispersion medium for nano-sized carbon particles. However, literature on the preparation and characteristics of palygorskite-carbon nanocomposites is scant. Using a hydrothermal carbonisation technique this study developed two nanocomposites on fibrous palygorskite from starch: the first without a post-synthesis treatment (Composite 1); and the second with an activation at 550 degrees C for 3 h (ramp at 10 degrees C min(-1)) under CO2 environment (200 mL min(-1)) (Composite 2). A uniform dispersion of nanoscale carbon spheres was formed on partially destroyed palygorskite structures. Composite 2, which indicated the formation of graphitised carbon nanoparticles, generated a 17-fold greater specific surface area than Composite 1 and also created micro- and mesopores in its structure. The nanocomposites, especially in Composite 1, contained organic surface functional groups (C H, C=C, C=0) and indicated variable affinity to cationic and anionic dye compounds. While Composite 2 adsorbed a larger amount of anionic orange II dye (23 mg g(-1)), Composite 1 adsorbed more cationic methylene blue (46.3 mg g(-1)). Isothermal and kinetic modelling of the adsorption data indicated that in addition to electrostatic attraction for methylene blue adsorptionon both nanocomposites, a pore diffusion mechanism was involved and the boundary resistance was greater for orange II than methylene blue adsorption. Being a material developed from green biomass (starch) and an abundant natural resource (palygorskite), these nanocomposites have immense potential for application in environmental remediation including in situ immobilisation of contaminants in soil.

Poly(gamma-glutamic acid)(gamma-PGA) formed self-assembled nanoparticles through electrostatic interactions with two different cationic polymers: poly(L-lysine)(PLL) and chitosan. The self-assembled gamma-PGA\/PLL and gamma-PGA\/chitosan nanoparticles were crosslinked by glutaraldehyde. Crosslinking of the ionic self-assembled nanoparticles with glutaraldehyde not only stabilized the nanoparticles but also generated a strong autofluorescence signal. Fluorescent Schiff base bonds (C=N) and double bonds (C=C) were generated simultaneously by crosslinking of the amine moiety of the cationic polyelectrolytes with monomeric glutaraldehyde or with polymeric glutaraldehyde. The unique optical properties of the nanoparticles that resulted from the crosslinking by glutaraldehyde were analyzed using UV\/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. We observed that the fluorescence intensity of the nanoparticles could be regulated by adjusting the crosslinker concentration and the reaction time. The nanoparticles also exhibited high performance in the labeling and monitoring of therapeutic immune cells (macrophages and dendritic cells).

Hydrogen production through water splitting has been set as a first-ranking target for artificial photosynthesis. Pursuing that goal requires the development of efficient and stable catalytic systems, only based on earth abundant elements, for the reduction of protons from water to molecular hydrogen. Cobalt complexes based on glyoxime ligands, called cobaloximes, emerged 10 years ago as a first generation of such catalysts. They are now widely utilized for the construction of photocatalytic systems for hydrogen evolution. In this Account, we describe our contribution to the development of a second generation of catalysts, cobalt diimine-dioxime complexes. While displaying similar catalytic activities as cobaloximes, these catalysts prove more stable against hydrolysis under strongly acidic conditions thanks to the tetradentate nature of the diimine-dioxime ligand. Importantly, H-2 evolution proceeds via proton-coupled electron transfer steps involving the oxime bridge as a protonation site, reproducing the mechanism at play in the active sites of hydrogenase enzymes. This feature allows H-2 to be evolved at modest overpotentials, that is, close to the thermodynamic equilibrium over a wide range of acidbase conditions in nonaqueous solutions. Derivatization of the diimine-dioxime ligand at the hydrocarbon chain linking the two imine functions enables the covalent grafting of the complex onto electrode surfaces in a more convenient manner than for the parent bis-bidentate cobaloximes. Accordingly, we attached diiminedioxime cobalt catalysts onto carbon nanotubes and demonstrated the catalytic activity of the resulting molecular-based electrode for hydrogen evolution from aqueous acetate buffer. The stability of immobilized catalysts was found to be orders of magnitude higher than that of catalysts in the bulk. It led us to evidence that these cobalt complexes, as cobaloximes and other cobalt salts do, decompose under turnover conditions where they are free in solution. Of note, this process generates in aqueous phosphate buffer a nanoparticulate film consisting of metallic cobalt coated with a cobalt-oxo\/hydroxo-phosphate layer in contact with the electrolyte. This novel material, H-2-CoCat, mediates H-2 evolution from neutral aqueous buffer at low overpotentials. Finally, the potential of diimine-dioxime cobalt complexes for light-driven H-2 generation has been attested both in water\/acetonitrile mixtures and in fully aqueous solutions. All together, these studies hold promise for the construction of molecular-based photoelectrodes for H-2 evolution and further integration in dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells (DS-PECs) able to achieve overall water splitting.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Highly sensitive humidity sensors made from composites of HEC filled by carbon nanofillers","Abstract":"Resistive type humidity sensors made from the composite films of HEC (hydroxyethyl cellulose) and MWCNTs (multiwalled carbon nanotubes) were developed.

For the convenience of sensors calibration, the non-linear resistance change ratios can be linearised by performing natural logarithm operation on them. A new sensitivity factor was defined based on this linear relationship between the logarithm of the resistance change ratio and relative humidity. For comparison, a reference humidity sensor was also made from the composite film of HEC filled by 50.0 wt-% CBs (carbon blacks). Compared with the HEC\/MWCNT sensors, the HEC\/CB sensor was of much higher sensitivity, but lower repeatability and stability under cyclic humidity changes.

A literature survey shows that such fire protective behaviour of wood coverings has been verified by different methodologies in several countries in and outside Europe. A new European system with K classes for the fire protection ability of coverings has been utilised for wood products. The classes are based on full-scale furnace testing, and the main parameter is the temperature behind the fire-exposed panel after different time intervals. Three levels are defined: 10, 30 and 60 min. An extensive test program has been performed according to the new European system. The results demonstrate that all K classes may be achieved for wood-based panels (particle board, plywood, solid wood panels, OSB-Oriented Strand Board and hardboard), and for solid wood panelling and cladding. The criteria for wood products are based mainly on panel thickness. The thickness for achieving each K class may vary slightly, depending on the wood product type and on mounting conditions and fixing means. Typical thickness to reach 10 min fire protection is 10-15 mm, for 30 min 24-30 mm, and for 60 min protection 52-54 mm. The end-use applications of wood products with K classes are mainly as wall and ceiling coverings and for protection of underlying materials and structures. Examples are protection of combustible insulation materials from being ignited, timber structures from becoming charred, and steel structures from reaching high temperatures.

The inner structure of the foam can take various shapes and hierarchical micro-structures depending on the manufacturing parameters. The compressive response of foams developed from these materials is currently a primary criterion for the material development. In this work, we focus on the connection between the non-linear part of the response and the inner structure of the material. We study the effect of internal contact and its contribution to gradual stiffening in the energy absorbing region and accelerated stiffening in the densification region of the large strain compressive response. We use the finite element method in this study and discuss the applicability and efficiency of different modelling techniques by considering well defined geometries and available experimental data. The relative contribution of internal contact is singled out and mapped onto the overall compressive response of the material. The effect of initial non-straightness of the cell walls is studied through superposing differing percentages of the buckling modes on the initial geometry. The initial non-straightness is seen to have a significant effect for only strains up to 1%. The secant modulus measured at slightly higher strains of 4%, demonstrates lesser effect from the non-straightness of cell walls. The simulations capture the compressive response well into the densification regime and there is an order of magnitude agreement in between simulations and experiments. We observed that internal contact is crucial for capturing the trend of compressive response. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

They can affect the concentration and composition of organic matter and have negative effects on aquatic organisms. Free radical scavengers (antioxidants) can remove these highly reactive species from the media. Some dissolved organic matter (DOM) constituents are widely known to present antioxidant properties (e.g. phenols and hydroquinones). However, little is known about the free radical scavenger capacity of DOM. Here we applied two simple, analytical assays (ABST and DPPH) to assess the antioxidant capacity of aquatic DOM, after their validation against a more complex electrochemical technique. These assays were applied to DOM from various environmental settings, including freshwater marshes, fringe mangrove estuaries and a coastal bay in Everglades National Park, Florida. All the samples presented different degrees of antioxidant activity depending on their origin and thus DOM quality.

Their microstructure, mechanical properties, and photocatalytic activity were investigated. The TGR samples exhibited well defined interconnected 3D porous network microstructure and good mechanical strength. Moreover, the pore size and the compressive strength could be easily adjusted by changing the content of TiO2, showing a decreasing tendency with the increase of the relative content of TiO2. The results of the photodegradation of methylene blue indicated that the photocatalytic activity of the TGR samples can be significantly enhanced, compared to the pure TiO2 nanoparticles. The TGR sample also showed good durability and reusability. The mechanisms resulting in the improvement of photocatalytic activity were investigated with DRS, PL spectra, and adsorption experiment under dark conditions. It was found that adsorption is the dominant factor for the enhanced photocatalytic activity.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Ba3P5N10Br:Eu2+: A Natural-White-Light Single Emitter with a Zeolite Structure Type","Abstract":"Illumination sources based on phosphor-converted light emitting diode (pcLED) technology are nowadays of great relevance. In particular, illumination-grade pcLEDs are attracting increasing attention. Regarding this, the application of a single warm-white-emitting phosphor could be of great advantage.

The synthesis of Ba3P5N10Br:Eu2+ was carried out using the multianvil technique. The crystal structure of Ba3P5N10Br:Eu2+ was solved and refined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and confirmed by Rietveld refinement and FTIR spectroscopy.

A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye, indocyanine green (ICG) with photoactive properties was intercalated into amine modified LDH interlayers by ion-exchange. The efficient positively charged polymer (chitosan (CS)) coating was achieved by the cross linkage using surface amine groups modified on the LDH nanoparticle surface with glutaraldehyde as a spacer. The unique hybridization of organic-inorganic nanocomposites rendered more effective and successful photodynamic therapy due to the photosensitizer stabilization in the interlayer of LDH, which prevents the leaching and metabolization of the photosensitizer in the physiological conditions. The results indicated that the polymer coating and the number of polymer coats have a significant impact on the photo-toxicity of the nano-composites. The double layer chitosan coated LDH-NH2-ICG nanoparticles exhibited enhanced photo therapeutic effect compared with uncoated LDH-NH2-ICG and single layer chitosan-coated LDH-NH2-ICG due to the enhanced protection to photosensitizers against photo and thermal degradations. This new class of organic-inorganic hybrid nanocomposites can potentially serve as a platform for future non-invasive cancer diagnosis and therapy.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Tuning assembly and enzymatic degradation of silk\/poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) multilayers via molecular weight and hydrophobicity","Abstract":"We report on enzymatically degradable nanothin coatings obtained by layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of silk fibroin with poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. We found that both silk beta-sheet content, controlled through dipping and spin-assisted LbL, and PVCL molecular weight regulate film thickness, microstructure, pH-stability, and biodegradability with a nanoscale precision. Thickness of (silk\/PVCL) films increased with increase in PVCL molecular weight and decrease in deposition pH. The impact of assembly pH on film growth was more dramatic for dipped films. These systems show a significant rise in thickness with increase in PVCL molecular weight at pH < 5 but become independent on polymer chain length at pH >= 5. We also found that spin-assisted films exhibited a greater stability at elevated pH and against enzymatic degradation as compared to their dipped counterparts. For both film types, the pH and enzymatic stability was improved with increasing PVCL length and beta-sheet content, indicating enhanced hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonded interactions between PVCL and silk. Finally, we fabricated spherical and cubical (silk\/PVCL) LbL capsules of regulated permeability and enzymatic degradation. Our approach gives a unique opportunity to tune thickness, morphology, structure, and biodegradability rate of silk films and capsules by varying silk secondary structure and PVCL length. Accounting for all-aqueous fabrication and the biocompatibility of both polymers these biodegradable materials provide novel platforms for delivery systems and medical devices.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Polyoxometalate (POM) grafted grooved nanofibrous membranes for improved self-decontamination","Abstract":"Combining unique fiber morphologies with self-decontamination technologies can enhance degradation of toxic compounds on fibrous substrates. Co-continuous electrospinning was used to fabricate nanofibrous cellulose acetate membranes with unique, grooved fiber morphology due to the selective dissolution of polyethylene oxide. The grooved cellulose acetate membranes were deacetylated to form grooved cellulose membranes. A self-decontaminating polyoxometalate (POM)double dagger(H5PV2Mo10O40) was synthesized and used to functionalize the grooved nanofibrous membranes as well as non-grooved nanofibrous membranes, pure cotton, 65\/35 polyester\/cotton fabrics and Tencel (R) peachskin fabric.

From the difference in surface densities between these phases, inter-domain dipolar interactions arise. These interactions are relevant for the determination of the spacial distribution of domains as well as their dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel way of estimating the dipolar repulsion using a passive method that involves the analysis of images of the monolayer with phase coexistence. This method is based on the comparison of the pair correlation function obtained from experiments with that obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations of a model system. As an example, we determined the difference in dipolar density of a binary monolayer of DSPC\/DMPC at the air-water interface from the analysis of the radial distribution of domains, and the results are compared with those obtained by surface potential determinations. A systematic analysis for the experimentally relevant parameter range is given, which may be used as a working curve for obtaining the dipolar repulsion in different systems.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Simulation-Based Approaches for Determining Membrane Permeability of Small Compounds","Abstract":"Predicting the rate of nonfacilitated permeation of solutes across lipid bilayers is important to drug design, toxicology, and signaling. These rates can be estimated using molecular dynamics simulations combined with the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model, which requires calculation of the potential of mean force and position-dependent diffusivity of the solute along the transmembrane axis. In this paper, we assess the efficiency and accuracy of several methods for the calculation of the permeability of a model DMPC bilayer to urea, benzoic acid, and codeine. We compare umbrella sampling, replica exchange umbrella sampling, adaptive biasing force, and multiple-walker adaptive biasing force for the calculation of the transmembrane PMF. No definitive advantage for any of these methods in their ability to predict the membrane permeability coefficient Pm was found, provided that a sufficiently long equilibration is performed. For diffusivities, a Bayesian inference method was compared to a generalized Langevin method, both being sensitive to chosen parameters and the slow relaxation of membrane defects. Agreement within 1.5 log units of the computed P-m with experiment is found for all permeants and methods. Remaining discrepancies can likely be attributed to limitations of the force field as well as slowly relaxing collective movements within the lipid environment. Numerical calculations based on model profiles show that Pm can be reliably estimated from only a few data points, leading to recommendations for calculating Pm from simulations.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Inspection of Wooden Poles in Electrical Power Distribution Networks in Artvin, Turkey","Abstract":"According to Trabzon Electricity Distribution Local Directorship's statistical data, there are 208.000 utility poles in Trabzon, 180.000 utility poles in Rize, and 121.000 utility poles in Artvin.

A promising method is based on combination of quantitative proteomics with SLLAC and uses active compounds anchored to magnetic beads via biotin-streptavidin interaction. We developed a simple and fast solid-phase synthetic technique to connect terpenes to biotin through a linker. Betulinic acid was biotinylated from three different conjugation sites for use as a standard validation tool since many molecular targets of this triterpene are already known. Then, a set of four other cytotoxic triterpenoids was biotinylated. Biotinylated terpenes were similarly cytotoxic to their nonbiotinylated parents, which suggests that the target identification should not be influenced by linker or biotin. The developed solid-phase synthetic approach is the first attempt to use solid-phase synthesis to connect active triterpenes to biotin and is applicable as a general procedure for routine conjugation of triterpenes with other molecules of choice.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Two Cu(II) complexes of triadimefon: crystal structure, antifungal activities and structure-activity relationship","Abstract":"Two Cu(II) complexes, [CuL2Cl2(EtOH)] 1 and [CuL4(NO3)(2)]center dot 0.5H(2)O 2 (L = 1-(4-chlorophenoxy)-3,3-dimethyl-1-H(1,2,4-triazole-1-y)-2-butanone, triadimefon) have been synthesized and their structures were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD). Crystal structural analysis shows that in complex 1, the copper cation lies on a crystallographic inversion center and is coordinated with two triazole groups, two chloride ligands and an ethanol molecule. In each unit cell, two pairs of adjacent [CuL2Cl2(EtOH)] molecules are linked by O-H center dot center dot center dot Cl hydrogen bonds to form a 2D plane. Complex 2 is octahedral with the metal cation bound to four triazole groups and two nitrate ligands. The geometry is elongated due to the more distant interactions between connecting nitrate O atoms and the Cu cation. The two complexes were screened for antifungal activities against five selected fungi using the mycelial growth rate method. The synergistic interactions between Cu2+ and triadimefon were also investigated by the Wadley approach, and the results reveal that the synergy levels for the ratio 1:4 of the molecular-level mixture of Cu2+ and triadimefon are better than that for the ratio 1:2. To better understand the structure-activity relationship, theoretical investigation of the electronic structure of the metal complexes has been carried out using density function theoretical (DFT) calculations. The results indicated that the Cu cation and the triazole originating from triadimefon are the active sites, and the decrease of the polarity of Cu2+ can contribute to the increased biocidal properties after complexation since it is responsible for the enhanced penetration of the metal complexes into the lipid membranes.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Electrospun Carbon Nanofiber Supported Zero Valent Iron Nanoparticles (nZVI@ECNFs) for Cr (VI) Remediation in Ground and Waste Water","Abstract":"Zero Valent Iron nanoparticles (nZVI) were synthesized and immobilized on electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNFs) surface in a controllable manner through redox reaction.

Here, we demonstrate that the preoxidation of graphite by impure manganese dioxide (MnO2) in a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) can efficiently improve the synthesis of GO when KMnO4 is employed as the oxidant. The prepared honey-like GO hydrogels possess a high yield of single-layer sheets, large sizes (average lateral size up to 20 mu m), wide ranges of stable dispersion concentrations (from dilute solutions, viscous hydrogels, to dry films), and good conductivity after reduction (similar to 2.9 x 10(4) S\/m). The mechanism for the improved synthesis of GO by impure MnO2 was explored. The enhanced exfoliation and oxidation of graphite by oxidative Mn ions (mainly Mn3+), which are synergistically produced by the reaction of impure MnO2 with H2SO4 and P2O5, are found to be responsible for the improved synthesis of such GO hydrogels. Particularly, preoxidized graphite (POG) can be partially dispersed in water with sonication, which allows the facile construction of flexible and highly conductive graphene nanosheet film electrodes with excellent electrochemical sensing properties.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Producing Lignin-Based Polyols through Microwave-Assisted Liquefaction for Rigid Polyurethane Foam Production","Abstract":"Lignin-based polyols were synthesized through microwave-assisted liquefaction under different microwave heating times (5-30 min).

The polyols obtained were analyzed for their yield, composition and structural characteristics using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. FT-IR and NMR spectra showed that the liquefying solvents reacted with the phenol hydroxyl groups of the lignin in the liquefied product. With increasing microwave heating time, the viscosity of polyols was slightly increased and their corresponding molecular weight (M-W) was gradually reduced. The optimal condition at the microwave heating time (5 min) ensured a high liquefaction yield (97.47%) and polyol with a suitable hydroxyl number (8.628 mmol\/g). Polyurethane (PU) foams were prepared by polyols and methylene diphenylene diisocyanate (MDI) using the one-shot method.

A life-cycle perspective on the consequences of design choices can guide the implementation of eco-design measures. However, not much literature is available thus far to empower designers in making sustainable design decisions. To meet this need, this article presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a wearable smart textile device for ambulant medical therapy.

The eco-cost approach was used to compare the LCA-results of the original prototype design against various eco-redesign options. The results suggest several priority areas for environmental improvement. One possibility is the replacement of silver based conductive yarns by copper based alternatives.

The XPS analysis revealed that the adsorption mechanism of Pb2+ and Cd2+ on the P(AANa-co-AM)\/GO hydrogel was ascribed to the chelation of -COO- with Pb2+ and the ion-exchange of -COO-Na+ with Cd2+, respectively. The P(AANa-co-AM)\/GO hydrogel possesses good reusability and excellent fixed-bed column operation performance, which suggests that the P(AANa-co-AM)\/GO hydrogel can be considered as a promising adsorbent for removing heavy metal ions from practical wastewater.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"A nickel cobaltate nanoparticle-decorated hierarchical porous N-doped carbon nanofiber film as a binder-free self-supported cathode for nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries","Abstract":"Rechargeable nonaqueous lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries have been considered a promising power source candidate due to their high theoretical energy densities. Here, we in situ fabricated a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous hybrid film composed of NiCo2O4 nanoparticle (NP)-decorated mesoporous N-doped carbon nanofibers (NCO@NCF), using single-nozzle co-electrospinning combined with annealing treatment. This hybrid film can serve directly as a binder-free self-supported cathode for Li-O-2 batteries that exhibit high specific capacity (5304 mA h g(-1)), excellent rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability (close to 100 cycles), benefiting from its structural and material superiority. Its hierarchical porous structure not only can facilitate O-2 diffusion and enhance electrolyte infiltration but also promises abundant Li2O2 storage. In addition, crisscross N-doped carbon nanofibers with high graphitization form a perfect conductive network, which ensures the fast transmission of electrons and avoids binder-induced adverse side reactions. Moreover, the homogenously distributed NiCo2O4 NPs possess efficient contact with both Li+ and O-2 and supply numerous catalytically active sites, thus leading to high-efficiency difunctional catalytic activities for the ORR and OER. Therefore, these encouraging results suggest an effective approach to obtaining high-performance nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries by optimizing the electrode structures and catalyst properties.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Genetically engineered mesenchymal stem cell therapy using self-assembling supramolecular hydrogels","Abstract":"Stem cell therapy has attracted a great deal of attention for treating intractable diseases such as cancer, stroke, liver cirrhosis, and ischemia. Especially, mesenchymal stemcells (MSCs) have been widely investigated for therapeutic applications due to the advantageous characteristics of long life-span, facile isolation, rapid proliferation, prolonged transgene expression, hypo-immunogenicity, and tumor tropism. MSCs can exert their therapeutic effects by releasing stress-induced therapeutic molecules after their rapid migration to damaged tissues. Recently, to improve the therapeutic efficacy, genetically engineered MSCs have been developed for therapeutic transgene expression by viral gene transduction and non-viral gene transfection. In general, the number of therapeutic cells for injection should be more than several millions for effective cell therapy. Adequate carriers for the controlled delivery of MSCs can reduce the required cell numbers and extend the duration of therapeutic effect, which provide great benefits for chronic disease patients. In this review, we describe genetic engineering of MSCs, recent progress of self-assembling supramolecular hydrogels, and their applications to cell therapy for intractable diseases and tissue regeneration.

In this work, mesoporous Si\/C microspheres of similar to 165 nm diameter are synthesized by magnesiothermic reduction of porous silica followed by chemical vapor deposition of a thin carbon layer. They consist of numerous primary Si nanocrystals of similar to 10 nm diameter which are interconnected, surrounded by abundant internal pores and coated with conductive graphitic carbon. These ameliorating structural and functional features offer a unique synergy that contributes to prevention of pulverization of Si\/C microspheres with a highly reduced volume expansion of similar to 85% upon full lithiation. The Si\/C electrodes deliver a reversible capacity of similar to 1500 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), an exceptional long-term stability of similar to 90% capacity retention even after 1000 and 2500 cycles at 1.0 and 4.0 A g(-1), respectively, and an excellent areal capacity of similar to 1.44 mA h cm(-2) after 500 cycles.","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Hydrophobic mesoporous adsorbent based on cyclic amine-divinylbenzene copolymer for highly efficient siloxane removal","Abstract":"This paper presents a new class of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4 siloxane) adsorbent based on the copolymer of divinylbenzene and a novel methacrylate monomer. The novel cyclic amine based methacrylate monomer was synthesized employing click chemistry and was polymerized to form a mesoporous adsorbent under solvothermal conditions and tested for siloxane removal. The D4 adsorption capacity of the novel adsorbent is 2220 mg g(-1), which is greater than the adsorption capacities of mesoporous poly(divinylbenzene) and commercial activated charcoal. The adsorbent retains 47% regeneration capacity after 10 usage cycles. The high specific adsorption is due to a combination of physisorption, caused by the mesoporosity and pore volume and chemisorption, as evidenced by spectroscopic results. The incorporation of functional groups into a mesoporous structure with significantly enhanced specific adsorption offers future opportunities towards tailored polymer properties for efficient industrial applications in siloxane removal.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Comparative analysis of individual house heating system based on electricity and combustion of alternative and fossil fuels","Abstract":"The paper reports cost analysis of house heating and preparation of hot water by means of the different heating systems.

A series of modified activated carbon aerogels (MACA-X, X=3, 6, 9, and 12 h) were then prepared by HNO3 oxidation of ACA with a variation of oxidation time (X) in order to investigate the effect of surface oxygen group on their electrochemical performance as supercapacitor electrode material. Electrochemical properties of ACA and MACA-X were measured by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge\/discharge, and EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) measurements. Among the samples, MACA-6 h showed the best rate capability and the highest specific capacitance. Thus, an optimal HNO3 oxidation condition was required for the highest supercapacitive electrochemical performance of modified activated carbon aerogel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

They have a high binding affinity and specificity for their targets. Agarose gels, nitrocellulose membranes, and adsorptive microplates are often used as carriers to immobilize targets in the SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) process, but the subsequent separation step is tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, we used magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as carriers to immobilize the target, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), which is convenient for fast magnetic separation. In this study, we first selected DNA aptamers against HBsAg by immobilizing HBsAg on the surface of carboxylated MNPs. The ssDNA library of each selection round was prepared by asymmetric PR amplification for the next selection round. To obtain aptamer sequences, the final selected products were purified by gel electrophoresis, then cloned, and sequenced. DNA aptamers that specifically bind to HBsAg were successfully obtained after 13 selection rounds. The selected aptamers were used to construct a chemiluminescence aptasensor based on magnetic separation and immunoassay to detect HBsAg from pure protein or actual serum Samples. There was a linear relationship between HBsAg concentration and chemiluminescent intensity in the range of 1- 200 ng\/mL. The aptasensor worked well even in the presence of interfering substances and Was highly specific in the detection of HBsAg in serum samples, with a detection limit 0.1 ng\/mL lower than the 0.5 ng\/mL limit of an ELISA in use at the hospital. This aptasensor can contribute to better detection of hepatitis B virus infection:","Label":"Material Science"},{"Title":"Nanoporous germanium as high-capacity lithium-ion battery anode","Abstract":"For the first time nanoporous germanium (np-Ge) was prepared by chemical dealloying allowing for mass production of electrodes for LiBs.

The Cr(VI) adsorption\/desorption properties and mechanisms of strongly and weakly basic magnetic adsorbents were compared through simulated wastewater. The strongly basic adsorbent exhibited low pH dependence, and the main adsorption mechanism was ion exchange. The weakly basic adsorbent exhibited high pH dependence, and the major adsorption mechanism was electrostatic attraction. Besides, the strongly basic adsorbent required higher desorption conditions than the weakly basic adsorbent owing to the difference of the desorption mechanisms. Furthermore, the removal selectivity of the strongly and weakly basic magnetic adsorbents was estimated by the chromium plating wastewater. The results demonstrated that the strongly basic magnetic adsorbents exhibited higher selectivity than the weakly basic magnetic adsorbents. In addition, the Pst-MIMCl was selected as the optimal magnetic adsorbent for Cr(VI) recovery from wastewater, with the advantages of strongly magnetic responsiveness, wide pH applicable range, high removal efficiency, high adsorption selectivity and good reusability.","Label":"Chemistry"},{"Title":"Effect of Meso- and Micro-Porosity in Carbon Electrodes on Atomic Layer Deposition of Pseudocapacitive V2O5 for High Performance Supercapacitors","Abstract":"Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of vanadium oxide is a viable means to add pseudocapacitive layers to porous carbon electrodes. Two commercial activated carbon materials with different surface areas and pore structures were acid treated and coated by V2O5 ALD using vanadium triisopropoxide and water at 150 degrees C. The V2O5 ALD process was characterized at various temperatures to confirm saturated ALD growth conditions. Capacitance and electrochemical impedance analysis of subsequently constructed electrochemical capacitors (ECs) showed improved charge storage for the ALD coated electrodes, but the extent of improvement depended on initial pore structure. The ALD of V2O5 onto mesoporous carbon increased the capacitance by up to 46% after 75 ALD cycles and obtained a maximum pseudocapacitance of 540 F\/g(V2O5) after 25 ALD cycles, while maintaining low electrical resistance, high columbic efficiency, and a high cycle life. However, adding V2O5 ALD to microporous carbons with pore diameters of <11 angstrom showed far less improvement, likely due to \"blocking off\" of the micropores and reducing the accessible surface area. Results show that ALD is a viable means to construct high-performance supercapacitors from activated carbon which is the basis for commercial products, and a clear understanding of carbon electrode pore structure, layer conformality, and layer thickness are necessary to fully optimize performance.","Label":"Material Science"}]
